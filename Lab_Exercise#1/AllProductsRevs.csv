"33","Makeup","L'Oreal Paris True Match Concealer 2N Vanilla","Jess Domingo","I'm a big fan of the True Match range but this concealer does not work for me. I have tried to make it work for a few months now but every single time it settles into my dry patches, clumps together and stands out, and creases within ONE HOUR. After every use, I've had to scrape it out of my fine lines. I do not recommend it at all but I'll give it two stars since it does lighten my undereye area. I'll keep using it on days I'm not too fussed about the texture but will not repurchase it again.

I'd had them done professionally before and just recently but they needed doing and I wanted to try myself. Very easy to use. Doesn't seem like it mixes well, but I've used the brand for my eyelashes before and it was the same. I only left it on for 3 minutes as I didn't want to overdo it the first time. I was really surprised! The colour was perfect, medium brown which was a much better colour than I get done professionally. Much more natural. I used vaseline the first time to ensure I didn't get dye anywhere else (didn't bother the next time). I didn't get down to the roots and missed a couple so I touched it up about a week later. Once again, I didn't leave it on for long but so easy to quickly touch up. I'll leave it on longer next time, so it hopefully lasts longer as well. Don't think it's extremely long lasting but so quick/easy/cheap that it's worth it.

"239","Luggage","Rockland Melbourne Hardside Expandable Spinner Wheel Luggage, Charcoal, Carry-On 20-Inch, Melbourne Hardside Expandable Spinner Wheel Luggage","Kevin Towers","Lots of packing room, light weight, conveniently placed handles on side for retrieving off luggage belts regardless which direction it is facing, fits on plane overhead, and wheels in all directions.  Hard shell outside however means no convenient pocket on the outside.  Otherwise, it is a very good choice.","Reviewed in Australia on 31 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"240","Luggage","Rockland Melbourne Hardside Expandable Spinner Wheel Luggage, Charcoal, Carry-On 20-Inch, Melbourne Hardside Expandable Spinner Wheel Luggage","Kevin Towers","Just got back from my trip and was very pleased.  Was able to use as carry on.  It rolled very easily thru the airport on four wheels and I was able to turn it sideways to push it down the airplane aisles when boarding the plane. Very light weight so it made it easy to put in the overhead. Would recommend.","Reviewed in Australia on 28 May 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"241","Luggage","Samsonite Oc2lite Suitcase","Sharyn Perry","I have wanted a Samsonite suitcase for a long time and when I saw on sale, had trouble choosing one, but decided on this one. It is well made, compact, with lots of space, no wasted space. No overdone colours or decoration. Comes with a nice slip storage bag. Fits inside my larger suitcase so doesnt need to take up any extra space for storage.","Reviewed in Australia on 5 January 2024","4.7 out of 5 stars"
"242","Luggage","Samsonite Oc2lite Suitcase","Steven White","I have boarded quite a few domestic flights with this little case, it's light weight, it's sturdy and can pack quite a load for a weekend or short holiday away.

"244","Luggage","Samsonite Oc2lite Suitcase","Thierry Scherer","As you would expect from Samsonite this is a very well constructed suitcase. It is very light and moves freely either as a 'pull along' or 'push along'. Good size for that 'week away' or longer if you are a 'light packer'.I do prefer cases with catches rather than zippers but this one, having a zipper, gives you the capacity to expand its volume. The internal pockets, straps and zippers divide up and protect your travel goods. The zip closing section in the lid ensures clothes arrive wrinkle free.
