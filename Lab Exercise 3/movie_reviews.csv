"1","Luca","planktonrules","17 November 2021","8/10","""Luca"" isn't one of the deeper Pixar releases but it did have one thing that made it stand out for me...I liked it. The characters were enjoyable and the story, though simple, was delightful.The plot is actually much like Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"". It's about some undersea creatures much like Selkies from Norse mythology...though the story is set in Italy. Luca is one of these creatures and although he doesn't know it, like a Selkie, he can turn human when he leaves the water. At first, he's scared when he discovers this, but when he meets Alberto, another such creature who has chosen to live on land, the pair become friends and soon go to the town of Portorosso. There, they make friends with Giulia as well as meet the town bully and all around jerk, Ercole. What's next? See the film.Slight is definitely the word for this film. But its sweetness and characters made it a hit for me...and I nearly gave it a 9. Well worth seeing and a story with a nice message.","Slight but most enjoyable."

"3","Luca","joostkale","18 June 2021","8/10","Stop it Pixar! Just stop it! Even the simplest stories are becoming masterpieces in the hands of Pixar. I don't know how they do it. It doesn't take the emotions risks like an Inside Out or Soul, nor is it a masterpiece of a screenplay like the Toy Story franchise, but boy oh boy I love it. Probably, its biggest flaw is also it's strength. It doesn't try to be the next masterpiece. It's Luca. It's a fun crowd pleaser with the typical Pixar emotional moments. It doesn't brake boundaries, but that's okay for me. For what it is, it's perfect! The story is sweet, and the characters are charming and lovely with real development. Yes, the story is a little predictable at times, but it doesn't bother the story much for me. I also love that the villain is the complete opposite of a twist villain. From the moment he pops on screen, you know he's the baddy, and he fits the movie very well. What makes this movie stand out, are the visuals. Holy crap, this movie is gorgeous! Literally the most beautiful movie I've seen this year so far. Also, the score, holy crap. Everything fits with the beautiful country that is Italy. I already know a lot of people will think it fits too much in the Pixar formula, but what can I see. The formula works, so why change it. It has his flaws, and it probably is not the next Pixar masterpiece, but it does work perfectly for what it is.","Is it groundbreaking? No, Its Luca!"
"4","Luca","TheLittleSongbird","27 May 2022","8/10","Have loved Pixar for years, well ever since seeing the first two 'Toy Story' films and 'A Bug's Life' when they first came out. Pre-2010 their films were consistently never less than very good and their best efforts outstanding. Pixar did start to vary post-2010, especially in the sequels, but the past seven years or so has seen some of their best work in 'Inside Out', 'Coco' and 'Soul'. Did like the concept for 'Luca', even if it was not a creative one.'Luca' turned out to be very, very charming and very high quality. It is not one of Pixar's best films by all means, other films of theirs are more creative conceptually and deeper and more complex emotionally and is not as good as their previous two films 'Soul' and 'Onward'. At the same time, there is more than enough to 'Luca' to stop it from being lesser Pixar, a list that includes most of the sequels post-2010 and 'The Good Dinosaur'.There is not an awful lot that is wrong with 'Luca'. It is very slight and takes its time to get going.Also thought that the portrayal of the bullies was overdone and on the stereotypical side.On the other hand, the animation is stunning. Especially the vibrant colours and beautiful Italian landscapes, while the characters expressions and movements are nuanced and natural. The music is a nice mix of stirringly upbeat and poignant-sounding in the quieter moments. As well as having an affectionately Italianate sound. The script is smart and knows its target audience without trying too hard to appeal to them or anybody outside it. The humour is genuinely amusing, while there is plenty of heart without being too sentimental.While the story is slight and not perfectly paced, it makes great nostalgic use of the Italian setting and doesn't resort too much to cultural stereotyping. Appreciated its handling of the messaging too, the messages are great and relatable ones that have a lot of resonance and relevance that could easily have been preachy but not once does the messages of loyalty, friendship and respect feel forced or condescending. There are plenty of sight gags that come thick and fast and they are genuinely funny, but there is a warm heart and poignancy too. Particularly in the friendship between the three leads. The characters are worth engaging with, only the bullies don't quite come off, while the climax has plenty of excitement. The voice acting is dynamic and emotive with the accents not coming over as too stereotyped.In conclusion, very good. 8/10.","Pixar in Italy"

"7","Luca","lisafordeay","18 June 2021","7/10","Luca is Disney's latest animated film from Pixar featuring the voice talents of Jacob Trembaly(Wonder),Jack Dylan Grazer(Shazam),Emma Berman,Staverton Raimondo,Maya Rudolph (Bridemaids) and Jim Gaffigan(13 Going On 30).Set in Italy the movie focuses on a young sea monster named Luca(Tremblay) who meets a mysterious boy named Alberto(Dylan Grazer) from the dry surface. However when its revealed that Alberto is also a sea monster in disguise, Luca decides to step out of the water and venture onto dry land as a human boy. The two later become best friends and they meet a young girl named Giulia(Berman) who has no idea that the two boys are sea monsters. The question though is will their secret get exposed?Overall I thought it was a nice film. The plot has been done to death as it reminds me of The Little Mermaid meets Splash as its a fish out of water film only the setting in this film Luca is in Italy instead of New York City or Denmark.Maya Rudolph and Jim Gaffigan voice Luca's parents along with Sacha Baron Coen as Luca's uncle along with Saverio Raimondo who voices the villian Ercole Visconti.What I liked about the film was about acceptance in the world and not to be afraid to show people who you are.Keep your ears open for celebirty chief Gino D'Campo as the voice of an italian priest.","Nice film from Pixar that deals with acceptance and knowing who you are"
"8","Luca","jessevasse","18 June 2021","8/10","Luca is a great Pixar movie! It may not be groundbreaking or revolutionary for its genre, but it is still highly enjoyable. The story is interesting enough to make one care about what will happen next, even though one should not expect events that are outside of Pixar's comfort zone.I did not cry at several highly liked movies of Pixar (e.g., Coco, Inside Out) and, fair enough, I did not cry at this movie either. However, I had a lump in my throat during the emotional scenes of Luca. For me, it is one of the more enjoyable Pixar movies, but I guess it is just a matter of personal taste in the end. So, please watch it yourself, and then decide whether the abundance of 1-star reviews is justfied! :)P. S. I really like the Roman Holiday references in this movie! Maybe Luca shares some similarities with Elio? ;)","Please do not take the short 1-star reviews too serious."

It is very slight and takes its time to get going.Also thought that the portrayal of the bullies was overdone and on the stereotypical side.On the other hand, the animation is stunning. Especially the vibrant colours and beautiful Italian landscapes, while the characters expressions and movements are nuanced and natural. The music is a nice mix of stirringly upbeat and poignant-sounding in the quieter moments. As well as having an affectionately Italianate sound. The script is smart and knows its target audience without trying too hard to appeal to them or anybody outside it. The humour is genuinely amusing, while there is plenty of heart without being too sentimental.While the story is slight and not perfectly paced, it makes great nostalgic use of the Italian setting and doesn't resort too much to cultural stereotyping. Appreciated its handling of the messaging too, the messages are great and relatable ones that have a lot of resonance and relevance that could easily have been preachy but not once does the messages of loyalty, friendship and respect feel forced or condescending. There are plenty of sight gags that come thick and fast and they are genuinely funny, but there is a warm heart and poignancy too. Particularly in the friendship between the three leads. The characters are worth engaging with, only the bullies don't quite come off, while the climax has plenty of excitement. The voice acting is dynamic and emotive with the accents not coming over as too stereotyped.In conclusion, very good. 8/10.","Pixar in Italy"

"37","Luca","lisafordeay","18 June 2021","7/10","Luca is Disney's latest animated film from Pixar featuring the voice talents of Jacob Trembaly(Wonder),Jack Dylan Grazer(Shazam),Emma Berman,Staverton Raimondo,Maya Rudolph (Bridemaids) and Jim Gaffigan(13 Going On 30).Set in Italy the movie focuses on a young sea monster named Luca(Tremblay) who meets a mysterious boy named Alberto(Dylan Grazer) from the dry surface. However when its revealed that Alberto is also a sea monster in disguise, Luca decides to step out of the water and venture onto dry land as a human boy. The two later become best friends and they meet a young girl named Giulia(Berman) who has no idea that the two boys are sea monsters. The question though is will their secret get exposed?Overall I thought it was a nice film. The plot has been done to death as it reminds me of The Little Mermaid meets Splash as its a fish out of water film only the setting in this film Luca is in Italy instead of New York City or Denmark.Maya Rudolph and Jim Gaffigan voice Luca's parents along with Sacha Baron Coen as Luca's uncle along with Saverio Raimondo who voices the villian Ercole Visconti.What I liked about the film was about acceptance in the world and not to be afraid to show people who you are.Keep your ears open for celebirty chief Gino D'Campo as the voice of an italian priest.","Nice film from Pixar that deals with acceptance and knowing who you are"
"38","Luca","jessevasse","18 June 2021","8/10","Luca is a great Pixar movie! It may not be groundbreaking or revolutionary for its genre, but it is still highly enjoyable. The story is interesting enough to make one care about what will happen next, even though one should not expect events that are outside of Pixar's comfort zone.I did not cry at several highly liked movies of Pixar (e.g., Coco, Inside Out) and, fair enough, I did not cry at this movie either. However, I had a lump in my throat during the emotional scenes of Luca. For me, it is one of the more enjoyable Pixar movies, but I guess it is just a matter of personal taste in the end. So, please watch it yourself, and then decide whether the abundance of 1-star reviews is justfied! :)P. S. I really like the Roman Holiday references in this movie! Maybe Luca shares some similarities with Elio? ;)","Please do not take the short 1-star reviews too serious."

The story succeed every-time they try to make this movie seems have increase tentions, they close it with a good portion of fun. Luca and Alberto shows all we been through with our best friend, separate. But, its not always a bad thing.That last scene also have powerfull feels. Good job, really good job.","It hit pretty different when you are at the age."
