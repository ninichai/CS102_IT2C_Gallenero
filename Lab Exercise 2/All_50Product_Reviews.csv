"85","Real-Technique-Miracle-Complexion-Sponge","Besser als der Beautyblender","Andra Raileanu","Was soll ich sagen: ich liebe sie einfach. Es sind 4 St√ºck in der Packung und Kosten so viel wie ein Beautyblender. Die Farbe ist okay. Ich mag kein Orange, aber darum geht es ja eher nebens√§chlich. Diese MakeUp-Schw√§mmchen sind gro√üartig, sie verteilen das Makeup optimal, wenn man sie anfeuchtet quellen sie fast auf das Doppelte ihrer Ursprungsgr√∂√üe an, Was ich echt super finde. Sie f√ºhlen sich gut in der Hand und auf der Haut an und lassen sich vor allem auch gut reinigen. Anders, als beim Beautyblender w√§scht sich dabei nicht einmal doe Farbe raus. Dazu zeigen die meisten Beautyblender bereits nach der ersten Reinigung ihre Schwachstellen und gehen kaputt, Was hier nicht der Fall ist. Jederzeit wieder, wobei ich mit 4 erstmal f√ºr eine Weile versorgt sein werde. Und auf jeden Fall weiterzuempfehlen. <3","Reviewed in Spain on 9 April 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Ho immediatamente provato i vari colori e devo dire che rispetto al costo √® un ottimo prodotto!!! La palette ha bei colori con toni caldi ed √® ottima sia per creare trucchi da giorno che da sera! I marroni che vanno nel rosso mattone sono veramente belli e possono essere esaltati e contrastati con i colori brillanti  che creano bei punti luce. Se voglio per un attimo dimenticare quanto costa il prodotto devo ammettere che alcuni colori, stranamente i matte e non gli shimmer , sono un po‚Äô polverosi ed in generale, rispetto agli ombretti della nyx venduti singolarmente, sono non troppo pigmentati. Meglio i colori brillanti che risultano pi√π pastosi e si riescono meglio a lavorare.  Utilizzando un primer la situazione ovviamente migliora, io uso la base della urban decay, che secondo me √® la migliore, ed utilizzandola gli ombretti non si sono  spostati di una virgola‚Ä¶trucco uguale  dalla mattina alla sera!! Devo dire che comunque rispetto a palette di marche economiche ( ricordando che la nyx in genere non √® una marca economica ma ha un costo medio‚Ä¶√® questa linea di palette particolarmente  economica!) fa un ottima riuscita quindi se un paio di colori nn scrivono troppo e qualcuno √® pi√π polveroso‚Ä¶bhe si pu√≤ comunque usare con un ottima riuscita ed i benefici sono pi√π dei costi!","Reviewed in India on 29 October 2016","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

In einem  Schwarz gehalten, beherbergt die Kunststoffverpackung 16 unterschiedliche Eye Shadow Nuancen. Diese lassen sich einfach auftragen und ebenfalls sauber verblenden. Sch√∂n finde ich, dass sie sich nicht in der Lidfalte absetzen.F√ºr ein dezentes Make Up am Tag und auch das Glamour- Abend-Make Up sind die Farben bestens geeignet. Wer es noch farbintensiver m√∂chte, sollte den Applikator etwas feucht machen und dann die Farbe aufnehmen. So ist sie noch deckender und leuchtender.Mir gef√§llt die Farbauswahl und sie hat alles, was ich mir von einem Eye Shadow w√ºnsche. Nat√ºrlich ist hier der Preis schon im mittleren Preissegment und man muss sich individuell fragen, ob es einem das Geld wert ist. F√ºr mich kann ich das mit einem klaren JA beantworten und deshalb gibt es von mir 5 Sterne.","Reviewed in France on 3 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

This does not dry your lips out either. Nothing is left behind on the glass when I drink or even use a napkin at dinner. Passes the kiss test too. I can't even figure out how to get it off, but I'm a little clued in. The other day I was having dinner with friends and I was saying this lipstick won't come off, but it did, right where my lips were touching the salty rim of a margarita. That's the only time.

I‚Äôve gone to the club, drank, sweat, and ate, and it literally doesn‚Äôt flinch. (The clear coat does have to be reapplied if you want the glossy look all night) The one time that the lip color did start to come off after one drink, I knew it was because I had been rushing at home and hadn‚Äôt waited for the base layer to set like I usually do. The only downside of this product is just a color theory type thing. The color looks different on different skin tones, which obviously can‚Äôt be helped. I‚Äôm black, so it looked more red on me than burgundy. Recently got the green color and I‚Äôm even more in love with that one!

"382","NYX-Professional-Makeup-Shine-Colour","Just okay","Jade Rush","Good color pay-off, completely opaque upon first coat.  The applicator, however, picks up and dispenses way too much product so it's best to wipe or scrape some off of the applicator tip before applying directly to the lips.  The texture is not too thick and lays comfortably on the lips.  I don't have lip fillers so my lips have the usual lines and creases and the product cracks where the lines are after a couple hours of wear for me.  The shade 18 On A Mission isn't as vibrant as I had hoped.  It's more of a medium blue tone red.

I‚Äôm now on my 3rd bottle in the space of a couple months however the price makes up for it considering the same product from a different brand would probably cost you more than double for the same size!Would love to see them bring out a larger size or different packaging to allow you to get the most product out of the bottle as the pump system doesn‚Äôt always get all the product out.Overall i love this primer and i won‚Äôt be changing anytime soon!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 April 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"410","l-f-Poreless-Primer-Fluid-Ounce","It‚Äôs ok, not great","Brysiewicz Jewellery","I recently tried the elf Hydrating Face Primer, and I have to say, my experience with it has been a bit mixed. While it didn't quite meet my personal expectations, I have noticed that my niece absolutely loves it.One of the standout features of this primer is its lightweight formula. It feels incredibly light on the skin, almost as if you're wearing nothing at all. It doesn't leave any greasy or heavy residue, which is a big plus for those with oily or combination skin.I also appreciate the hydrating properties of this primer. It does a decent job of moisturizing the skin, leaving it feeling soft and supple. I noticed that it helps to smooth out any dry patches, providing a more even canvas for makeup application.Additionally, this primer claims to fill in pores and fine lines, and while it does a decent job in that regard, I didn't notice a significant difference in the appearance of my pores or fine lines. It provided a subtle smoothing effect, but not to the extent that I was hoping for.One aspect that I found particularly beneficial was the natural matte finish. It helped to control shine and kept my makeup looking fresh for a longer duration. However, I did find that it emphasized any texture on my skin, such as acne scars or bumps.While I had mixed feelings about this primer, my niece, who has different skin concerns, absolutely loves it. She has dry skin and found that this primer provided the perfect amount of hydration for her. It also helped to prolong the wear of her makeup and created a smooth base for foundation.In conclusion, the elf Hydrating Face Primer is a lightweight and hydrating option that provides a natural matte finish. While it didn't completely meet my personal expectations in terms of pore-filling and line-smoothing abilities, it has proven to be a great fit for my niece's dry skin. If you have similar skin concerns, this primer may be worth a try.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

My fluffy powder brush cannot pick up the loose powder easily so I have to use another loose power brand like L‚ÄôOreal where the cap is palm sized and scatter some of this banana powder on it for my brush to pick up.

Habe bisher als MakeUp Artist nie ein anderes Powder gehabt. Ich m√∂chte es auch gar nicht ausprobieren.Es passt sich farblich gut an.Ich nutze es unter den Augen, ein wenig am Nasenr√ºcken, ein wenig am Kinn, einen Klecks auf der Stirn und jeweils einen schmalen Streifen an den Wangen unterhalb der dunklen Kontur. So kommt die Kontur besser zur Geltung.Eine gute Grundlage ist ein Muss. Die Foundation bzw der Concealer sollte daf√ºr geeignet sein. Wer dazu neigt, dass sich das MakeUp in den F√§ltchen absetzt, sollte an den Stellen auf das Powder verzichten.Immer auf die Menge achten.Ich mache mir ein wenig von dem Produkt in ein Sch√§lchen und nehme es direkt mit dem Blending Sponge auf und tupfe es damit vorsichtig auf. Das lasse ich dort so, bis ich den Rest vom MakeUp (Lidschatten etc) fertig habe und verblende dann (ohne Druck) alles mit einem gro√üen fluffigen Pinsel. Das l√§sst das Powder ebenm√§√üig erscheinen und entfernt √ºbersch√ºssiges Powder.Wer Probleme mit diesem Produkt hat, sollte sich erst ein ""wie mach ich das"" - Video anschauen, bevor man dem Produkt die Schuld gibt, denn beim Baking kann man viel falsch machen ebenso bei den Pinseln und Schw√§mmen.Wer zu viel Powder benutzt oder es mit zu viel Druck auftr√§gt oder verteilt, der wird nachher sehen, dass das Produkt unsch√∂ne R√§nder hinterl√§sst und buchst√§blich br√∂ckelt.Ich hoffe, ich konnte helfen.","Reviewed in Spain on 21 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"768","Conceal-Correct-Contour-Palette-3CP01","Love the formula and great intro to cream contour","Amazon Customer","Just looking for an affordable introduction to practice my cream contour. Nyx surprised me with it formula which is easy to apply, easy to work with, and lasts all day. I compare it to other products I've tried such as Colourpop and ABH creams, and Maybelline and Wet 'n Wild liquids.I gave it four stars because I think I can safely assume you will only use 2-3 colors. It's great for finding a match for your medium shade, but there's only going to be one darker shade and one (maybe two) light shade. I wouldn't necessarily buy this again now that I know what colors I actually use and would then look for a larger 3-pan kit from Nyx.Also of note: I use the technique where you apply the contour before foundation. I mention this because I apply the contour a little heavier and lean into the drama. Once you apply foundation, you can blend out and soften it up. I think this technique also helps with the ease of use and product longevity. If you use a different technique, I imagine you might have a different experience with this product (but maybe not!)","Reviewed in the United States on 6 January 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

She's more interested in makeup and learning contouring and at 13 it's a great time to start learning and experimenting with makeup. I went with this shade palette because she has a more pale complexion. And let me say it's not the easiest to find good lighter contour palettes. This is a very good palette for anyone with a lighter complexion.This is cream. Not powder. But that tends to be a personal preference. It's easy to work with. Easy to blend and layer. I've used it a few times also and have been pleasantly surprised by how nice it is. Especially for the price. It's no $90 palette but there have definitely been days where I've preferred this over my more expensive palettes and it's been perfect for my daughter.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 September 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"818","Conceal-Correct-Contour-Palette-3CP01","Love the formula and great intro to cream contour","Amazon Customer","Just looking for an affordable introduction to practice my cream contour. Nyx surprised me with it formula which is easy to apply, easy to work with, and lasts all day. I compare it to other products I've tried such as Colourpop and ABH creams, and Maybelline and Wet 'n Wild liquids.I gave it four stars because I think I can safely assume you will only use 2-3 colors. It's great for finding a match for your medium shade, but there's only going to be one darker shade and one (maybe two) light shade. I wouldn't necessarily buy this again now that I know what colors I actually use and would then look for a larger 3-pan kit from Nyx.Also of note: I use the technique where you apply the contour before foundation. I mention this because I apply the contour a little heavier and lean into the drama. Once you apply foundation, you can blend out and soften it up. I think this technique also helps with the ease of use and product longevity. If you use a different technique, I imagine you might have a different experience with this product (but maybe not!)","Reviewed in the United States on 6 January 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

She's more interested in makeup and learning contouring and at 13 it's a great time to start learning and experimenting with makeup. I went with this shade palette because she has a more pale complexion. And let me say it's not the easiest to find good lighter contour palettes. This is a very good palette for anyone with a lighter complexion.This is cream. Not powder. But that tends to be a personal preference. It's easy to work with. Easy to blend and layer. I've used it a few times also and have been pleasantly surprised by how nice it is. Especially for the price. It's no $90 palette but there have definitely been days where I've preferred this over my more expensive palettes and it's been perfect for my daughter.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 September 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I wish I had better news because I so wanted to love this pallet. I was less than impressed, that's for sure. I would go with the double ended contour/highlighting stick from NYX for sure!

Desafortunadamente no me funcion√≥ porque tengo pesta√±as muy lacias, necesito usar rizador siempre, pero en cuanto me puse el producto, se me bajaron inmediatamente, no se si es muy pesado pero si tienes lacias o delgadas las pesta√±as no te lo recomiendo para nada porque te baja las pesta√±as.

I just got these lipsticks in and I love them! They all came sealed in plastic. The colors are beautiful and they dry so well on my lips. They even come with a little lipgloss. For some reason they smudge on your arm, but not on your lips. It's very weird lol, but I'm glad they dry and dont smudge. I know some people don't really like lipsticks that dry really well, but if you do then this is the perfect product for you. They also kinda smell like chocolate in a way. I hope this review helps someone. I try to make my reviews as honest as possible to help people shop quicker, because I know shopping online can be kinda a hassle sometimes lol.Future update: These don't last if you eat or drink. So these may not be the best to wear to a party or a place that your going to eat food. If you do end up eating food, just bring a backup lol.

This blush, highlighter, and contour set from Trip is a delightful addition to my makeup routine. The products glide on smoothly and blend seamlessly, giving a polished finish to my look.For optimal results, I've found that using a primer underneath is essential. Additionally, using a high-quality brush for blending ensures a flawless application, enhancing the overall effect.Being on the paler side, I appreciate that this color combo works well for my skin tone. I can imagine it will be even more stunning in the summer with a tan. Despite the compact size of the set, I received two of each combo, which was a pleasant surprise and added value to the purchase.In conclusion, makeup set is a must-have for those seeking an easy-to-use, travel-friendly trio that delivers a lovely, natural glow. I'm impressed with the results and look forward to using it regularly.","Reviewed in Canada on 7 January 2024","3.9 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It's a shame because I love the product. I just finished chemo and my face is so pale.  The trio combination is lightweight but moisturizing and looks great. It would be a five star for me but I guess I should have done my homework before ordering.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Als jemand, der sich gerne schminkt, aber nicht viel Erfahrung mit komplizierten Techniken hat, fand ich dieses Set perfekt f√ºr meine Bed√ºrfnisse.Die cremige Textur der Sticks l√§sst sich butterweich auftragen, und die Farbauswahl bietet gen√ºgend M√∂glichkeiten, um unterschiedliche Looks zu kreieren. Der Blush verleiht meinen Wangen eine frische Ausstrahlung, der Highlighter sorgt f√ºr subtilen Glanz, und der Konturierungsstift gibt meinem Gesicht Kontur und Definition.Die handliche Gr√∂√üe der Sticks ist ein gro√üer Pluspunkt. Ich nehme sie √ºberall hin mit, und sie passen problemlos in meine Handtasche. Das erleichtert Auffrischungen unterwegs.In Bezug auf die Haltbarkeit bin ich zufrieden. Die Produkte halten normalerweise den ganzen Tag √ºber gut, obwohl ich bei besonders hei√üen Tagen oder langen Abenden eine kleine Auffrischung ben√∂tige.Alles in allem bin ich begeistert von diesem Set und w√ºrde es jedem empfehlen, der nach einfachen und effektiven M√∂glichkeiten sucht, sein Make-up zu optimieren. Es hat mir geholfen, mein Gesicht in Szene zu setzen und dabei immer noch nat√ºrlich auszusehen.","Reviewed in Germany on 23 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I was using Boomstick color and I like it, but the cost is way too high.  This brand was on a super sale, so I got two sets; Rose Quartz and Coral and they are great.  This is truly the first product that I have ever really liked to wear as makeup.  It blends and looks so natural and I use a brush to blend it all and it goes on so beautifully.

THese little sticks are pretty good for the money. They are quite greasy and wear off quickly.  The moisturizer is like smearing grease on your face, so it's not a stand alone moisturizer for me, more of a quick plumper for lines around my mouth. I'd prefer a cheek color that wasn't so dark but I can make this one work for my fair freckled face. The eye highlighter looks really good, again, a bit greasy so have to apply carefully so it doesn't smudge the eye pencil I wear on my lower lashes.

"1092","Rimmel-London-Brow-Eyebrow-Sculpting","Gives a natural result","Rodney Hunt","This eyebrow palette is very small, you could pop this in your handbag for touch ups quite easily. I bought the Medium Brown as I am quite fair skinned. The left hand colour is the wax, the right hand colour is the setting/filling powder. One of the application brushes is firmer than the other and is for applying the wax. The softer one is for the powder. The brushes are very small, though, so I think I might buy some full size ones as the supplied ones are ok for carry around but are a bit fiddly to use.Application was easy enough, and I'm a total beginner at this! As a 60-something lady I have quite sparse brows now so I was looking for something to add a little colour and definition to what little I have left. The wax part of the procedure went on nicely and helped smooth and define the brow shape. The powder needs a little more care as it can be pretty dark if you use too much. If dark and thick is what you want I'm sure you could achieve that but us older gals need something more subtle and it does that too as I hope you can see from my before/after photo (my first attempt!).Overall my first impression of this little kit is pretty good. I'm actually quite new to doing make-up and I've been searching for something reliable for my eyebrows. I tried a propelling wax pencil that broke off after a dozen uses and wouldn't have lasted long anyway there was so little in it, and also a traditional brow pencil that proved impossible to sharpen reliably. Two expensive and disappointing products. There's very little to go wrong with this type of palette and brush style of brow grooming and the price makes it a good value product. I figure it should last me a few months at least so I'm hopeful this is the answer for me. I can recommend you give it a try if you have experienced similar problems and frustrations with eyebrow products as I have.","Reviewed in Australia on 24 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I have worn it about five times now and it has stayed on until I have eaten- and even then it fades rather than peels or smudges off- so it‚Äôs still gives a great natural look. Took nothing to whip out the crayon and re-do the colour depth back to what it was.I love that it didn‚Äôt smudge or smear across my face when my hair slipped across my lips, and I love that it didn‚Äôt go on thick and plasticy, like some of the other long-wear lip products do (you know those ones that almost peel off when you eat? *gag*)","Reviewed in Australia on 7 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1198","Maybelline-SuperStay-Crayon-Lipstick-Adventure","A great lipstick that lasts and stays without drying out your lips","Cristina","NOTE WELL!  Do as much research as possible on the color you're thinking about getting, as I had the misfortune of purchasing an everyday shade (""Lead the Way"") that was wayyyy too pale for my complexion. As it wasn't returnable, I basically gave it to my fairer-skinned mom as a gift. Watch Tiktoks and Youtube reviews with people close to your coloring to get a real idea of what it will look like on you, as the pictures can and even tend to be inaccurate. And make sure you know whether it's returnable before you buy that color.As for the product itself, it's really exceptional for such a good price. Feels great on your lips, lasts a crazy long time, unlikely to get on your teeth -- just a really great lipstick. I, falling toward a more olive complexion with yellow undertones,  found the best to be:-""Own Your Empire"" is an absolutely perfect red. Think Peggy Carter from Captain America. I'm in love with it, just on the SLIGHTEST blue side of the orange/blue red lipstick scale. Anyone who's had issues with their One Red Lipstick being a little too orange, this one's for you.-""Pave the Road"" is an excellent, subtle shade that's just slightly darker and richer than my natural lip color -- really great for everyday.-""Chase Dreams"" is a more fun, slightly lavender-tilted option for when you're wearing clothes that don't look great with straight-up red.I'm one of those people who frowns at paying $8 for one lipstick, but it's really worth it.

"1211","NYX-Professional-Makeup-Brightening-Primer","This thing works AMAZING‚Ä¶.on some people","Mari G","Yes; it‚Äôs like clear pasty glue. And that‚Äôs why it worked for me. I‚Äôm a pro athlete and I sweat gallons. I don‚Äôt wear a lot of makeup but I have adult acne blemishes and dark spots that no one ever sees thanks to a combination of products; STARTING with this primer. I don‚Äôt use a lot and I rub it in my skin immediately as once it dries, that‚Äôs it! It stays put, and so will whatever you apply on top of it. So careful. A little goes a long way and you must spread it well and thin. It feels thick but once rubbed in your fingers it kind of gets more malleable. I only put in my t zone and cheeks; avoiding eye area completely. Otherwise it will pull your skin and make you look wrinkly.I dab a little MAC concealer over the blemishes and spots, spray a brush with Airbrush foundation (Jerome Alexander or Dior) and a bit of powder (MAC FIT or inexpensive Coty Mineral Translucent) and BOOM. Perfect looking face!! Even my dermatologist compliments me on how my face looks and how I cover up my uneven color and blemishes.I don‚Äôt put a picture here of before and after (I should) but Im not going to embarrass myself with my before look. It works for some people like me. I hope this works for you because for me this was a life changer. From sweaty makeup mess and nosy people asking about my blemishes and dark spots (rude). Now no one has to obsess over my post 40 acne blemishes and we all can move on to truly important things.FYI‚Äôs: No scent. A tube lasts me about two months of daily use. Not sold anymore in my local pharmacy. Hard to find; not sure why. I have combination skin that is dry on the forehead. Acne prone.

This certainly did not disappoint, as it is very close, if not the same, as the Hourglass.  Very silky and lightweight, which is exactly what I was hoping.  The only drawback is that it sometimes separates within the tube, and comes out like the liquid didn't mix with the primer part (if that makes sense).  AND, funny, that Hourglass does the exact same thing.  It works better if you keep turning the tube over or upside down in between uses.

"1231","NYX-Professional-Makeup-Brightening-Primer","SUPER MATTE - Not for the faint of heart!","Alicia R","Alright so I just received this and am gonna list my thoughts on a first impression basis:It has the look and consistency of very thick petroleum jelly, to the point where it takes a bit of muscle to squeeze out of the tube. I got a bit skeptical, because I've used clear primers in the past (the Smashbox one and Maybelline Master Prime) that haven't lived up to their claims of blurring pores and making your makeup last. I also was thinking it may be difficult to spread evenly over the skin, since it's sooo thiccccc! But, just like with petroleum jelly, once it hits the warmth of your skin, it just melts into a much more malleable consistency.This is when the stuff starts to behave VERY differently from your everyday vaseline...Instead of sitting on top of your skin in a layer of grease, it fully absorbs into your pores, and ANY trace of oil or moisture is GONE! So are your pores! The skin on my face literally feels TIGHT!That being said, WHOO! BE CAREFUL!I have hyperhidrosis (AKA excessive sweating, especially from my head and face, which is like the suckiest thing ever) - and the reason I mention it is because I have tried antiperspirant face lotions that feel A LOT like this. I couldn't find a list of ingredients on the package, but if I had to guess, I would say that this stuff contains aluminum (maybe even a lot of it) which will clog your pores and form a barrier between your skin and the oxygen. In other words, if you are super oily and acne-prone like I used to be, this will help control it for a special occasion here and there, but will make your skin 1,000% worse in the long run if you use it on a regular basis! - Again, that's only my first impression, but if your skin does not take kindly to strange new cosmetic formulas, I would use this stuff very sparingly.My skin does get noticeably more oily in the summer, and I usually LOVE a matte primer, but this is the first time I felt like a product made my skin look dried out and wrinkled. I bought it thinking it would help my makeup wear longer, I had no expectations that it would be so matte and blurring. I'm shook if you can't tell, lolOverall - I REALLY really like this primer, and if I had to bet I would say it's going to keep my makeup in place 1000% longer than any other I've tried, but it's also a weapon you must use with caution! lol","Reviewed in the United States on 10 June 2021","4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It's definitely a glow and not a glitter.  It's a very beautiful look for those who want a dewy look.  For reference, I have very fair skin.  My only complaint is that it is thick and the dropper is not the best delivery method.  It should be in a tube, and L‚ÄôOr√©al needs to address this and redo the packaging.  I took one star off for this reason.  I have priced other products like this, and this is by far the most economical.

"1351","NYX-PROFESSIONAL-MAKEUP-Peekaboo-Neutral","Great lip liner for the price","ri","So- this lip liner is the matte dryer waxy kind (not the type that glides and feels moisturizing). However, I personally prefer this type as I find they last longer and look the most realistic if you like to subtly overline. The shade peekaboo neutral is for you if you have naturally light/medium true pink lips (or want it to match a lipstick in that range)- it will be the PERFECT slight overline shade. Does not have a cool/grey undertone. If you prefer that try the shade natural. It's a bit deeper and slightly more neutral rather than pink. Nude pink is significantly lighter/brighter pink than both peekaboo and natural. It would be best for lips that are naturally quite a light/brighter pink.

I was racking my brain thinking who would send me candy. Then there was a card on top with a big Thank You & flowers on the border. I had to get my glasses to see what was going on. Then I finally could see it was the magnifying mirror I had ordered from Beauty Planet. There was a sturdy cinch bag to protect the mirror included & initially the 20X magnification blinded me. I had to slowly edge inwards before it finally came into focus so it is very powerful for me. It was a lovely surprise to see with what care this package was sent & it brightened my day. Thank you.

This is easy to apply, pretty easy to remove, even after my little girl decided to paint her entire head. A bit of warm water, or warm soapy water and comes straight off. A good little tip is to put a bit of moisturiser on beforehand. As for the product. It's really laid out nicely, really compact, a nice little mirror. Why not 5 stars?  Well there are 2 side panels that come out and these can be quite stiff, so I have to help my 4 year old to open it. If she does it herself she ends up with make up all under her nails and on her fingers. Also the brushes are a little bit on the bargain basement side. But you could always buy some proper brushes for them. But overall the product is very safe on the skin, even very delicate skin.

They will love and respect you when they are older.","Katie","As it is for christmas, I'm sure my almost 5 year old will love it. I have no doubts she will. It's a way to make her feel happy, pretty and get to learn makeup with out a daddy thinking she is to young or going overboard. Dad's let your girl's be girl's, that's what they do. Break down a lil and she will truly love and respect you for it. Just some advice as I have teens aswell. So if you are thinking about getting this for your little princess, do it. And moms, try to make dad break down and buy it. When a little girl, who gets her security from a father, receives something like this from him, it only grows the father daughter bond. This way when she is older there is more respect and communication. Amazing how a (twenty something dollar) toy can literally make all the difference not only for christmas but also your future relationships with your daughters.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 June 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I assume this is hard to prevent given it's shipped and possibly thrown around during shipping. My girls didn't care of course. (To the manufacturer, switch the lip gloss and eye shadows so the powders don't get into the lip gloss.) Like I said, my girls (age 3 and 5) love it, so I'm not sending it back.

I'm a budget-friendly person when it comes to makeup; I don't wear a lot because I work in healthcare. This spray is great because it helps prevent my makeup from rubbing off under my mask at work. It also dries matte and I prefer no-shine. I layer my setting powder on top which helps keep oil from building up throughout my shift. I don't use more expensive ones to compare this to, but if you're looking for something lower cost this is a great option. One bottle lasts me about 4 months and I use anywhere from 5-7 sprays across my face almost daily. I also have sensitive skin and easily break out, and this has never given me any issues.","Reviewed in Japan on 12 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

And before that, I was lacking in my hygienic knowledge requirement for my makeup applicators; specifically brushes. I have been hand washing my brushes and I find that the process wears my brushes down fairly quick so I end up having to completely replace not too long after. I boughtthis thinking it would help. This is my review:It‚Äôs ok. It does not get all the foundation off. I noticed that the brush still had some foundation on it, but I was trusting the process. After the 3rd time using it, with soap and warm water, and still seeing some residue on the brush, I decided to hand wash it to get the residue off. I did that till the water ran clear. I then filled the container with warm/hot water to run the brush through with the battery handle and repeated the process till the water ran clear, and then did it again to help dry the brush.Overall: not great.

"1627","Cleaner-Super-Fast-Electric-Machine-Automatic","Doesn't fully clean, but It's not the worst","Amazon Customer","Cleaning makeup brushes is personally annoying from water everywhere, hands getting pruney, etc, it's not fun. I had a Lumia 2 Makeup Brush Cleaner, and you're better off doing it yourself. I've tried the scrubbing mat, and honestly, those so far are the best way to properly wash them. So when I came across this, I was ridiculously excited to try it. Here are my thoughts:Pro:- It's the quickest way to clean your brushes- leaves little to no mess (assuming the water is below the max line)- dries extremely quickly (preventing growing bacteria, in theory)- Battery operated (But, sadly it dies quickly)Cons:- it doesn't wash your brushes 100% ( If you are lazy, I would recommend doing this daily and once a week manually hand washing it.. or at least monthly)- The attachment doesn't fit all brushes (some are too tight or way too loose)- Some attachments might fit quiet snugly that the handle and bristle might get broken, which isn't fun when using expensive brushes- I personally don't agree with drying your brush without rinsing it out first","Reviewed in the United States on 1 November 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1628","Cleaner-Super-Fast-Electric-Machine-Automatic","A great device but...","Chloe K","the company really needs to update the description of this product.  It does not come with 13 different sized brush handle collars, there is no USB connectivity, and there is no cleaning pad.  So wish all this was included!  It comes with 8 collars and is battery (2 AAA, not included) operated.  With this said, I will say it's a great device.  I cleaned 5 brushes in the span of approximately 10 minutes or so and could probably have done that in less time if I hadn't been so fascinated by this little machine.  Just a note - take care when removing the collar from each brush.  If the brush handle is stuck in the collar, I think it's best to remove the collar & brush from the unit and then remove the brush from the collar.  This will help avoid breaking the spindle on the cleaner handle (although they do provide 2 spindles) and the spindle, once inserted in the main handle, is not removed.  Personally, I really don't enjoy cleaning my makeup brushes.  It's tough to get them any where like when they were new and the drying time seems like forever.

I try to stay away from anything you will need to charge and i hate anything that you would have to connect to a USB (hassle)  but it can use a re-design on:-  the plastic cup gets blurry and will need more effort to clean but since I use it often, its always blurry so maybe a better plastic or glass would be good in the future-  A wider, taller cup for bigger brushes-  more rubber brush attachments that are taller so we can use it for air drying as well-  a carrying case and a travel size option would be greatI find that warm water works best (depending on your brush) with the soap you use but I still like to use a rubber brush cleaning mat with it but this definitely cuts the drying time","Reviewed in the United States on 8 January 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1714","Physicians-Formula-Murumuru-Bronzer-Sunkissed","UN BURRO SFUMABILE E COMPLETAMENTE NATURALE","Elejess","Ciao a tutti, sono sempre alla ricerca di prodotti performanti, che mi consentano un makeup naturale e non finto, innaturale.Ho una carnagione molto  chiara, per cui la ricerca del bronzer merita molta attenzione da parte mia, altrimenti risulta troppo scura per il mio sottotono, diventando un effetto terribile.Mi sono imbattuta per caso in questo bronzer, ho letto le varie recensioni entusiaste, per cui decido  di acquistarlo e provarlo sulla mia carnagione.Il brand Physicians formula √® un marchio americano,  arrivato in Italia da un po', produce prodotti per il makeup, da blush a bronzer, rossetti, gloss, insomma un brand completo sopratutto per  creare prodotti cosmetici e trattamenti per la pelle ipoallergenici, adatti soprattutto per le pelli sensibili.LA MIA ESPERIENZA CON IL PRODOTTO:Appena aperto il pack, vi invade un profumo che vi catapultera' nella stagione estiva, un odore intenso tra cocco e pina colada, buonissimo, ovviamente con la stesura del prodotto, scompare.Il packaging √® colorato, di plastica rigida,  ha uno doppio scomparto per la spugnetta in lattice,  che non utilizzo poiche' questo prodotto si presta di piu' con il pennello,  all'interno non √® presente lo specchio, peccato, credo che sia importante per un prodotto di questa tipologia, sopratutto per i ritocchi, ma vabb√®. me ne faro' una ragione, scherzi a parte.La reperibilita' in Italia nei negozi fisici √® scarsa, mai nelle grandi citta' potete trovarlo all'Upim. all'OVS e alla Coin,fortunatamente esiste il web dove possiamo trovare quasi tutto, di qualsiasi brand.CARATTERISTICHE PRODOTTOIl prodotto si presenta come una polvere quasi con texture cremosa, ma di fatto rimane polvere, viene menzionato come burro per la sua formulazione con oli e burri naturali.Sulla cialda vi √® un disegno di onde che ricordano il mare, ha un ottima pigmentazione e scrivenza gia' dalla prima applicazione, molto sfumabile , sopratutto  √® stratificabile sino ad ottenere l'effetto desiderato, personalmente non stratifico, come gia' detto ho la pelle chiara.La colorazione Deep  si adatta perfettamente alla mia pelle chiara, √® un caramello dorato, che conferisce un colore abbronzato alla mia pelle in modo naturale,  √® quello che cercavo in un bronzer, lo utilizzo da un anno circa sia in inverno, sia in estate.Esistono due colorazioni :- Deep- Light bronzerLa durata √® di circa 5 ore, non evidenzia la pelle secca, ne le linee di espressione, la polvere √® molto sottile per cui non conferisce strato.Adoro questo bronzer, inoltre alla mia pelle sensibile non ha apportato nessun fastidio.La spedizione √® stata nella media.Il prodotto mi √® stato recapitato gia' utilizzato, ho avuto questa percezione poiche' la spugnetta contenuta nel pack era sporca, per carita' la cialda era intatta, ma un prodotto che va sul viso, non va assolutamente bene  per  igiene, il problema √® stato risolto direttamente con il venditore gentilissimo, si √® scusato dell'accaduto, ed ha provveduto a rimborsarmi il prodotto.Ovviamente ho riordinato il bronzer, fate attenzione quando si tratta di prodotti che vanno applicati al viso o al corpo, controllate bene i sigilli, che sia tutto rigorosamente intatto.Per quanto riguarda il prezzo varia dai siti,  il prezzo piu' basso attualmente √® qui su Amazon.Credo d avervi detto tutto, alla prossima.","Reviewed in Spain on 19 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Ich hatte nur nicht gedacht, dass die Konsistenz wirklich so buttrig (im Sinne von fettig) ist. Deshalb hat sich der Bronzer nicht so gleichm√§√üig und ""leicht/nat√ºrlich"" auftragen lassen. Au√üerdem war mir die Farbe (Sunkissed) etwas zu dunkel, obwohl nicht nicht super hellh√§utig bin.Insgesamt sah das Ergebnis immer sehr nach ""Bronzer"" aus - und nicht im nat√ºrlichen Sinne.Schade, ich hatte hohe Erwartungen, weil dieses Produkt seit Jahren sehr gute Bewertungen hat.

To some they may feel cheap, but as a professional Mua they are actually perfect. I have to use alcohol to sanitize and it‚Äôs VERY hard on brushes and handles, the wood ones always chip and crack.

"1811","MAANGE-Foundation-Eyeshadow-Blending-Concealers","Useless as makeup brushes and they smell weird","Sarah","These brushes smell really weird, as other reviewers have already noted. The smell is some kind of sweet-ish chemical, possibly adhesive. I washed my brushes thoroughly with Dove white soap. It did remove the weird smell. However, during the washing process there was a lot of shedding from some of the brushes. One of the brushes lost large chunks when I rinsed them. They might have been okay brushes at this point but for some reason they don't hold powder well. I have never seen anything like it before. I tried to load up an eyeshadow brush and apply it to my hand and it took three applications of shadow before it was anywhere near an acceptable opacity. I tried to really load up the brush with shadow but the brushes do not hold product well at all.They are soft, I guess, but they fail at being makeup brushes.

Ok so there are25 different brushes you get in this makeup set.For me  the best part is that each brush is labeled for what its used for. This is so helpful!!! Like what type of brush it is for which face part or makeup application job.So for example one brush may say for contour or another for eyes / eyebrows etc.Each brush head shape and size varies accoding to its purpose. The bristles are synthetic and nylon to be more specific. They are soft and infact would have prefered some to not be as soft especially for contouring.I personally am not gonna use all these brushes because my makeup routine is not so complex but for sure there are a few that will be very useful.The brushes are attractive , lightweight and easy to clean because I found they dried very fast.I hope this helps","Reviewed in Canada on 25 May 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars",NA
"1848","MAANGE-Foundation-Eyeshadow-Blending-Concealers","Lots of brushes","Wild Bill","I would like to apologize to every woman that wears makeup.  I had no idea that there were so many different types of brushes to apply different makeup and such for every part of your face.  Twenty five to be exact.  No wonder it takes them so long to get ready.  Pure madness.  I got this for my wife to shorten her getting ready and apply makeup time, but all it did was make that time longer.  Each brush has a specific use and is for a specific part of the face.  An artist doesn't have these many brushes.  It's a good thing though so you don't mix colours and cross contaminate the brushes.  These brushes need to be washed before using them because they have a bad odour to them and you don't want to take chances that your face will break out or have an adverse affect.  Now all you need is a nice container to hold them all and have them at your finger tips.  I particularly like that each brush is labelled to tell you what it is used for.","Reviewed in Canada on 7 June 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Verschwimmt auch gut in Kombination mit anderen Produkten, sowohl mit Schw√§mmchen als auch Pinsel zu smudgen. Allerdings h√§lt er nicht besonders lange, finde ich, das ist ein Nachteil. Ein anderer nachteil: wenn man jetzt eher dieses Schattierungskonturieren machen will, braucht man eher so einen grau-braun Ton (damit das dann nat√ºrlich ist), dieser stift ist eher in richtung rehbraun f√ºr die √ºblichen W√§rme Bronzer Effekte. Ich komme mit den anderen hochwertigeren graubraunen, die auch eine festere Textur haben, nocht so super zu recht Vielleicht kann ich die technik (noch) nicht so gut, weshalb ich dann dennoch diesen rehbraunen Ton bevorzuge.

Il colore chiaro √® praticamente un illuminante e nn un correttore-  questo nel colore universal, in altre tinte invece √® pi√π compatto- ed aiuta quindi facilmente a creare luci ed ombre.

It's super easy to apply, yeah it may be a tad greasy but it's easily fixed underneath powder, I would recommend using a translucent powder however as the highlighting disappears when using a coloured powder! The only downside to this though is that you don't get much in the stick and runs out really quickly I bought mine about 3 weeks ago and I'm already buying another, well worth the money for what it does and how easy it is to handle!:)Tip: if youre not using translucent powder it works best for me to dab with a brush I found than to blend it all in, the only part I would recommend blending/smudging whatever you want to call it is the cheekbone contour!

"1904","MAANGE-Professional-Foundation-Eyeshadow-Blackgold","its looks more rose gold","Marie","This set of makeup brushes covers most of what you need to apply a ""normal"" makeup. Makeup artists may disagree, but I think so üòäSome customers complain of a bad smell when unpacking the brushes, but I don't think it was that bad at all. The brushes are packed individually in a case which I feel is rather poor and which I don't use. The feeling I got when I unpacked the brushes was very positive, it already felt like they were of good quality.I use the brushes for both makeup base and eye makeup. I might think there is a brush missing for eye makeup, otherwise I am satisfied. Brushes do not absorb products and do not lose bristles. They are soft and easy to use.I've only cleaned them twice so far, but they seem to hold their shape even then.Perhaps I have a strange way of applying foundation, as I first spread the foundation with my fingers a little lightly and then use a brush to work the product in. One thing annoys me, the handle of the brush naturally gets sticky from the product I have on my hand.

Took nothing to whip out the crayon and re-do the colour depth back to what it was.I love that it didn‚Äôt smudge or smear across my face when my hair slipped across my lips, and I love that it didn‚Äôt go on thick and plasticy, like some of the other long-wear lip products do (you know those ones that almost peel off when you eat? *gag*)","Reviewed in Australia on 7 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2038","Maybelline-SuperStay-Crayon-Lipstick-Adventure","A great lipstick that lasts and stays without drying out your lips","Cristina","NOTE WELL!  Do as much research as possible on the color you're thinking about getting, as I had the misfortune of purchasing an everyday shade (""Lead the Way"") that was wayyyy too pale for my complexion. As it wasn't returnable, I basically gave it to my fairer-skinned mom as a gift. Watch Tiktoks and Youtube reviews with people close to your coloring to get a real idea of what it will look like on you, as the pictures can and even tend to be inaccurate. And make sure you know whether it's returnable before you buy that color.As for the product itself, it's really exceptional for such a good price. Feels great on your lips, lasts a crazy long time, unlikely to get on your teeth -- just a really great lipstick. I, falling toward a more olive complexion with yellow undertones,  found the best to be:-""Own Your Empire"" is an absolutely perfect red. Think Peggy Carter from Captain America. I'm in love with it, just on the SLIGHTEST blue side of the orange/blue red lipstick scale. Anyone who's had issues with their One Red Lipstick being a little too orange, this one's for you.-""Pave the Road"" is an excellent, subtle shade that's just slightly darker and richer than my natural lip color -- really great for everyday.-""Chase Dreams"" is a more fun, slightly lavender-tilted option for when you're wearing clothes that don't look great with straight-up red.I'm one of those people who frowns at paying $8 for one lipstick, but it's really worth it.

"2055","BS-MALL-Brushes-Synthetic-Foundation-Concealers","Love these!","Cap","I have had these brushes for a little over a year at this point and absolutely love them.I really can't find anything negative to say about them.I suppose if I were to try hard, my only complaints would be a) they do take a couple days to dry after washing & b) I would prefer for one of the fluffy angled brushes -simply because there are two that are nearly identical- to be replaced with a larger fluffy dome brush (BS-Mall sells one in another set of theirs that is fantastic). However, that is just me being a little fussy. The drying time doesn't bother me really. More so a heads up for anyone who is use to their brushes drying more quickly.All of these brushes perform just as they should & better than you would expect considering the price. They all pick up & deposit color very very well. I find that they perform as well with liquid/cream products as they do with powders. The top of bristles are white which allows you to see how much product you have picked up & what you may have used them with last. This also helps you see/decide when you may need to clean them. They are fluffy & soft but nicely dense.The large tapered/pointed face brush is more stiff than the other face brushes but still as soft. This makes it nice for applying setting powder under the eyes or areas that need concentrated placement.I appreciate the shorter handles on the face brushes. I find them much easier to use than longer handled brushes I've owned/tried in the past. They are just the right length. Not so short that you feel you lose control or may drop them but not so long that you feel as though you are flopping them around when you are applying makeup.I still have not seen Any bristles come out of Any of these brushes! This surprises me. I also have washed them many times and they are still holding strong. None of the ferrules have come off of the handles & none of the brush heads are misshapen as of yet. I do always dry them upside down after washing.Overall, these are fantastic brushes & you absolutely cannot beat the price. I have had very nice brushes in the past...that were much much much more expensive.... yet, I do not see myself going back to them. They are really on an, at least, equal level...I even prefer these over many of those! Just saying...You may need to fill in this set with a few pieces (large fluffy powder brush, eyebrow spoolie, lash/brow comb, etc) but there aren't many you'd need & you could easily apply all of your makeup with just this set if you needed/wanted.I can't imagine ever regretting a purchase from this company. To date, I've bought at least 3 different sets from this seller & have been equally pleased with them all.Just buy them! You can't beat the price to quality & their money back guarantee is peace of mind anyway.*I paid for these with my OWN money at the full price they were listed. I did NOT receive these for free or at a discount. I was NOT asked to alter or ""up"" rate my review. Even if I were ever approached to do so, I would always rate & review items at my own honest opinion. I'm a stay at home Mom of four (& homeschool), so I can be pretty picky about what I've spent our money on :P I hate the dishonest/""bought"" reviews. I always appreciate the ones who have been provided the product for free or at a discount, yet are still honest, twice as much.

They did lose a couple first wash, but there were only like 2 bristles in my sink once I was done. Perfect for the price.

The warm water over time will detach the wood from the actual brush but is easily fixed with krazy glue or nail glue. I would recommend washing these with a face cleanser you trust to pull out a lot of grossness. I use an oil based cleanser by kose or biores Japanese oil cleanser. They both work really well in pulling out the dirt and grime which is needed for any product going on your face.don't share face products with family unless its thoroughly sanitized but even at that I would still not recommend sharing because everyone has their own skin needs and  routines","Reviewed in the United States on 7 July 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2080","BS-MALL-Brushes-Synthetic-Foundation-Concealers","Purchased for my 30 something yr old sister for Christmas, super impressed","Amber","I purchased these brushes as a Christmas present for my sister. She has no experience with brushes and I thought a wide variety set would allow her to find what she likes.  I do wish that the company's name wasn't on the outside container BUT the brushes were great! They look and feel like luxury brushes. If the outside container really bothers you, you could always gift them in a cute brush bag but honestly the container is def great for traveling and if you wanted to just use it as cups to hold the brushes both the top & bottom of the container are large enough to hold brushes so you can separate the set out according to how you like and the brushes will not fall over. I was actually surprised how nice they are. On the brushes themselves, it has the name/what the brush is for so if you lose the little information pack that comes in the package, don't worry! They have everything from foundation brushes to extremely thin liquid eyeliner brushes that honestly could be used for nail art if you're into that (that's now thin and precise it is).  I would def recommend this, esp for a gift. It looks high end and feels high end.","Reviewed in the United States on 2 January 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2092","BS-MALL-Brushes-Synthetic-Foundation-Concealers","not as versatile as one would think","shyla","they are not that soft, I have seen better ones in the drug store, but for value they will suffice.  I have used a couple of the brushes only thus far.  Specifically for the  exact reason I purchased them.  I Am experimenting with Cheekbone Beauty products but I  find that just using my fingers is not sufficient.  So I have used 2 of the larger brushes to  blend that product out  (using a color for undereye concealer)  and it works okay but it definitely  is not as soft as I was expecting for that delicate area.  None of them are.  The smaller brushes  are too small for that purpose.  I just fell that although the price point is great they are not the best BUDGET  brushes out there.I was never a big fan of makeup, when I was younger and did makeup  daily it consisted of  eyeshadow, liner, mascara, a bit of blush  and a lip gloss.  Now that I am older I rarely  wear any makeup, my eyelashes seem to be shorter and I have dark circles under my eyes.  So my main  purpose today is if I am going out to look less tired, I use some concealer,  do my  very sparse eyebrows and  a touch of  mascara. Maybe a little blush and of course a lip balm  Most of the brushes I got in this set for me go unused unless I decide to  do what I once did, but  I do not feel the need to.  I did go to the drug store and get another brush  that is much softer  and there is a world of difference in how soft it is compared to these.  But it is a different brush, a size that is not included in this set.  I have also used one of the brushes for the  cheekbone beauty primer stick,  to  stipple it on as that makes it easier to use the  Unify fair1 as a concealer on that very delicate under eye area.  I personally would not recommend purchasing this set  and I will eventually  get the brushes I  want that yes do cost more, but are softer and less likely to pull and tug on your skin.  Once I  play with more eye makeup like shadows I may  see how well the smaller brushes do for that, but for now for what I need these were not the best choice.","Reviewed in Canada on 26 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2101","Real-Technique-Expert-Concealer-Brush","I had no idea what I was missing!","Jen Dixon","Background: Thought I'd write this up, because as a person who prefers sheer but effective foundation & concealer coverage AND spends a lot of time in front of cameras for my job as an online instructor to a global audience in HD, finding stuff that makes my skin feel fresh & flawless at 50 is important to me, not only for the cameras, but for myself too.I bought this concealer brush as a bit of an impulse buy during Prime Day (along with a new foundation brush) because I'd seen various makeup videos on YouTube using similar ones. I have always used my fingers, and had no idea that a brush would give such superior results.I have very naturally youthful, wrinkle-free skin for my age, but my skin is getting more delicate and thinner. My night owl tendencies are more obvious under my eyes as well...Being able to more precisely & delicately apply & manipulate concealer is a godsend!And when concealer is settling into the under eye skin, you can easily use this brush (after wiping off any excess product on the bristles) to sweep away any concealer that has collected in the fine crease under the lash line.I've tried it with three different liquid concealers of various price points: NYX HD, Too Faced, and Make Up For Ever HD. All went on beautifully, and I'd rate them in that order too (Make Up For Ever being the most impressive finish).I am hooked.I only recently switched to using a foundation brush (a cheap one, but it has converted me), so I can't wait until the Real Techniques one I also bought on Prime Day arrives.When cash allows, I'll upgrade from both of these by Real Techniques to pro-level brushes, but for now? For now, I look better than ever before, and am thrilled.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 July 2022","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"2102","Real-Technique-Expert-Concealer-Brush","pennello correttore: valido, resistente, trucca bene. Prezzo molto buono","Guevera","La spedizione √® stata celere come sempre, il pacco √® arrivato integro e ben imballato. Si tratta di un pennello di Real Techniques.PACKAGING E CONTENUTO DELLA SCATOLA:Il prodotto arriva in una confezione di plastica trasparente con il contenuto a vista. Sul retro sono stampate tutte le informazioni sul pennello.CARATTERISTICHE DICHIARATE E/O RISCONTRATE:‚Ä¢ Marchio: Real Techniques‚Ä¢ materiale setole: sintetico‚Ä¢ manico in metallo‚Ä¢ Made in ChinaFUNZIONAMENTO:Il pennello prima di essere utilizzato √® consigliabile che venga lavato.Va lavato con sapone neutro, non messo direttamente sotto l‚Äôacqua corrente. Le setole non vanno strizzate e va lasciato ad asciugare a testa in gi√π.Si tratta del pennello RT 210 cio√® un pennello a testa piccola con setole dense e fitte per applicare il correttore nella zona del contorno occhi.CONSIDERAZIONI COMPLESSIVE:Esteticamente il pennello √® molto bello: mi piace il colore e mi piace la forma del manico che √® facile da impugnare ed √® salda durante l‚Äôutilizzo. La superficie del manico √® liscia ma non scivolosa quindi si riesce a usare il pennello con facilit√†.Ho apprezzato molto che sul pennello non solo fosse scritto il numero cos√¨ da poterlo riconoscere tra gli altri ma che fosse anche scritto il nome cos√¨ da capire immediatamente come usarlo: aspetto che ho trovato molto utile per chi inizia ad approcciarsi al trucco e non conosce ancora bene tutti i pennelli e il loro scopo.Le setole del pennello sono sintetiche ma non ho riscontrato particolare problematiche: tutte le setole sono diritte, c‚Äô√® una buona quantit√† di setole che rende il pennello abbastanza denso durante la stesura del trucco, le setole risultano morbide e non occorre insistere sui punti. In circa 20 pennelli acquistati mi √® capitato di trovare una setola pi√π lunga delle altre solo in due pennelli.Per quanto riguarda la stesura del correttore in crema o liquido che utilizzo, l‚Äôho trovata davvero soddisfacente: raccoglie bene il prodotto, lo stende bene senza creare macchie, non si sforma durante l‚Äôutilizzo cos√¨ di creare dei buchi nel make-up e copre con precisione.Lo sto utilizzando da meno di un mese e lo lavo una volta alla settimana e fino a ora non ho riscontrato alcun problema: si pulisce bene, non resta macchiato di prodotto, non perde setole e una volta asciutto non perde la forma.Rapporto qualit√†-prezzo ottimi. I materiali li ho trovati di buona qualit√†, e trucca molto bene. Il prezzo di circa 8‚Ç¨ (al momento dell‚Äôacquisto e della recensione) l‚Äôho trovato tra i pi√π economici per la categoria.Spero che la mia recensione possa tornarvi utile e... buon acquisto!!","Reviewed in Italy on 1 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2156","Senbowe-Upgraded-Electric-Cosmetic-Automatic","I might have messed mine up???","mrsdirk","This is my first time using a product like this. I have NEVER washed my brushes. That‚Äôs a lie‚Ä¶I washed a couple of them about 5 years ago with just soap and water, and they stayed damp forever, and I then I couldn‚Äôt use them for days. But I‚Äôve been seeing these kits on Buzzfeed for years now, and since i‚Äôm approaching 40, I'm trying to take better care of myself. I didn‚Äôt look at the instructions before my first attempt. It comes with these 2 little white pegs. I put it on incorrectly the first time, and I had to use a kitchen tool to remove it, with quite a bit of force. Then I see the instructions and it says that once it‚Äôs in there, don‚Äôt remove it. So I have no idea why they sent 2 of it‚Äôs not meant to be replaced. Anyway, I got the hang of it, but I don‚Äôt know if I messed something up with the yanking or if it‚Äôs just the weight of the brushes. When I turn it on, I have to start the spinning off with my hand. Again, that might be my fault. It is very cool to watch though. I like how quickly they dry with the spinning. If they made stuff like this when I was in my youth, then yes, I would‚Äôve washed my brushes regularly. Like I seriously have one powder brush that I‚Äôve had for over 10 years and this was the first time it was cleaned. Be careful with the big brushes though, and how you store them after cleaning. The wand on that one broke off years ago, but it‚Äôs so big that I didn‚Äôt need it. I have a mug that I set all of my brushes in, and bc I don‚Äôt have the stem on that brush it went into the mug, and got beaten up by other brush stems. When I finally went to use that one again, the fibers were going every which way. I don‚Äôt know if I ruined the brush. I‚Äôll try to wash it again and hopefully the shape comes back‚Ä¶but if it doesn‚Äôt, we‚Äôll, I‚Äôve been needed to retire that thing for years now!!","Reviewed in the United States on 22 February 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"2157","Senbowe-Upgraded-Electric-Cosmetic-Automatic","Great product! However it has some downsides","Crawford","I bought this because I need to clean my brushes regularly or I get really bad breakouts and stys. But that takes a lot of time, and sometimes with denser brushes soapy residue is really hard to get out which annoys me to no end. Let me start by saying, it works! It doesn‚Äôt get all the staining out if you use bright colors like I like to do, but it gets all the pigment out. If you have double sided brushes, this could be a problem if you want to clean both sides, because chances are that you will only be able to clean the larger side of the brush, because the attachment won‚Äôt fit if you turn it around to clean the other side, it‚Äôll just screw up your brush and fly off. But it came with enough attachments to fit all of my brushes! Another thing, make sure you have multiple triple A batteries in rotation before you start using this. This thing eats through them like no ones business, so buy the value pack if you have a lot of brushes like I do. But it‚Äôs a small price to pay for your sanity as I‚Äôd rather buy more batteries then go back to scrubbing my brushes constantly. All and all it‚Äôs a good product, and would recommend buying it if you‚Äôre like me and have to wash a lot of brushes constantly.","Reviewed in the United States on 28 March 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I hardly ever leave reviews, but this product is worth it. My brushes have been neglected for awhile and are several years old, so I purchased this based on the reviews. Because my brushes were so gross, I sprayed each one with Dawn power wash and let it sit for a few seconds, then used Dawn liquid soap in the container before putting in medium temp water. Each brush has been restored. The entire process for 14 brushes took about 20 minutes, but I think if I do this regularly, it'd take about 15 seconds per brush.

"2172","Senbowe-Upgraded-Electric-Cosmetic-Automatic","Works, but not like magic!","Jess Barrios","It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve cleaned my brushes, let‚Äôs just say that. My foundation brush is newer, but it was still pretty filthy as the bristles are very compact. It took a few sessions to really get that, my powder, & blush/highlighter brushes very clean. What I suggest you do is:- fill an empty water bottle with lukewarm water & soap/brush cleaner, you‚Äôll use that to refill your cleansing bowl.- have a secondary container to place the used water in.Follow the directions provided in the packaging, but without drying your brushes completely. Check your bristles to see if you need to continue cleaning. I typically only had to do this on the large face brushes. If the water is starting to get very dirty, I discard it in the second bowl & refill the the water bottle. Once clean, dry all the way.The smaller brushes dry VERY QUICKLY for the most part, so be careful not to over dry them. I suggest drying them slowly & reshaping the bristles as you go.

"2190","Senbowe-Upgraded-Electric-Cosmetic-Automatic","Efficient clean with a caveat","Pchan","It gets the job done quickly. However, it doesn't work with all brushes. For example, I have a set that have ""wavy"" handles. This throws off the spin of the machine and it will vibrate until the brush falls out. This also happens with very small or thin handled brushes. I don't know why this is. Also the collar on the plastic bowl seems poorly designed. I understand it is to keep the brushes from spattering during spin, but it should just be one piece, not two that screw together poorly. Otherwise, it gets the job done quickly and efficiently. I would buy a model that is better made, I use rechargeable batteries but USB might be better. It beats doing it by hand with a mat. Does clean deeply but might take a couple extra dunks/spins for heavily soiled brushes.","Reviewed in the United States on 14 April 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

However, when it comes to cleaning the larger foundation, highlighter/blush brushes that have longer bristles it struggles. When the larger brushes are in the water it is met with a lot of resistance and bogs down a bit, even stopping a few times. I followed the directions and made sure the brushes were in correctly, the larger ones did not get nearly as clean. For all brushes this worked amazing for getting the water out of the brushes, so even if I hand wash larger brushes with a mat, I would still use this to get the water out.

"2254","MAANGE-Professional-Foundation-Eyeshadow-Blackgold","its looks more rose gold","Marie","This set of makeup brushes covers most of what you need to apply a ""normal"" makeup. Makeup artists may disagree, but I think so üòäSome customers complain of a bad smell when unpacking the brushes, but I don't think it was that bad at all. The brushes are packed individually in a case which I feel is rather poor and which I don't use. The feeling I got when I unpacked the brushes was very positive, it already felt like they were of good quality.I use the brushes for both makeup base and eye makeup. I might think there is a brush missing for eye makeup, otherwise I am satisfied. Brushes do not absorb products and do not lose bristles. They are soft and easy to use.I've only cleaned them twice so far, but they seem to hold their shape even then.Perhaps I have a strange way of applying foundation, as I first spread the foundation with my fingers a little lightly and then use a brush to work the product in. One thing annoys me, the handle of the brush naturally gets sticky from the product I have on my hand. It's surprisingly difficult to wipe the brush handle clean afterwards.Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with this purchase and can really recommend this set of makeup brusches!","Reviewed in Sweden on 7 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

FYI, the photo shows the extension, but it comes separately","martin stubbs","Nice mirror and I love it!! I‚Äôve come back, almost two years after buying the mirror, to write a review because I realize that of all the things I‚Äôve bought on Amazon over the years, this mirror is not only the thing I use daily, but it‚Äôs been the most practical and reliable thing I own! It deserves a great review! I use it mostly at home, but there have been days in which I‚Äôve had to rush out of the house without my makeup, so I grab my makeup bag and the mirror and I‚Äôll put my makeup on in a parking lot later that day! Just place the suction cup from the extension, onto your windshield and voila, you‚Äôre good to go! Sometimes the suction needs a little moisture, I mean that‚Äôs something I thought everyone knew but apparently some people are writing in their reviews that the suction doesn‚Äôt work. üôÉ I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre not putting a little moisture (from the faucet if you‚Äôre in the bathroom, but a little lick will do in a pinch, don‚Äôt say ‚Äògross,‚Äô you‚Äôve all done it ) on the suction cup will make it work just fine, unless the suction cup happens to be defective, which I doubt.The mirror works great! It does need batteries, so I bought the Amazon rechargeable batteries and charger, specifically for this mirror because it might end up using 3 AA batteries about once a month, depending on how long it takes to do your makeup. My kids also use the mirror for some reason (despite the fact that they have perfect vision) so our batteries wear out fairly quickly, as well as the fact that I use the mirror daily and for at least 1/2 an hour a day. Amazon rechargeable batteries don‚Äôt keep the brightness as long, but as long as you don‚Äôt mind charging them regularly, that‚Äôs fine, otherwise regular batteries keep the brightness for a lot longer.  It‚Äôs sturdy too! I‚Äôve dropped it many times, due to clumsiness, and it keeps on ticking.Lastly, as I recall, the company is woman owned, so that‚Äôs another plus! If you‚Äôre about to turn 40, or you know a contact lense wearer or makeup wearer, or even a skin care enthusiast, get it for yourself or a friend! It‚Äôs definitely worth it! ü§©I should add that I just remembered that when I originally ordered the mirror, it didn‚Äôt come with the extension and it was during Covid, so not only did I have to wait for it for almost a month, but had to pay extra for something I assumed came with it, since the photo included the extension. So there‚Äôs that. But it was worth it! Honestly, I think they should just include the extension (and charge more) because I don‚Äôt see how anyone could use it without it. It doesn‚Äôt really stand up on its own, I don‚Äôt believe.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2446","Jessup-Professional-Foundation-eyelashes-Natural-Synthetic","Great Zoeva Dupes. Natural Hair Brushes Have a Learning Curve.","Amazon Kunde","1. White hair brushes typically indicate animal (natural) hair. These are meant for dense application of powder products. The black hair brushes are synthetic, for cream and liquid products (they don't soak up the product as much as natural hair does) and lighter powder application (they don't grab powder as well as natural hair). That's why the eyeshadow brushes and blush, highlight, etc brushes in this set are natural hair and the foundation, duo fiber, brow and powder are synthetic (you want a light dusting of powder for all over). It's hard to find natural hair brushes in this price range and these are really good! They are a natural-synthetic blend. That's also why some people are saying the white hair brushes shed and fray more than the synthetic (black) ones-- that's not uncommon and they may not be washing them properly. Please research how to wash your natural hair brushes! Condition them or use oil to keep them from fraying; treat them like your own hair. Natural hair brushes will change your makeup game!2. These brushes are meant to be Zoeva dupes, down to the name and number on the handle and the natural-synthetic composition. I own some of the Z ones these are meant to dupe and Jessup are really good quality for the price! The Z ones are a little softer, but even those can shed a bit at first. I've included a comparison photo. I haven't washed the Jessup brushes yet, so I'll update once I do about how they hold their shape.3. Most of the brushes are pretty self explanatory, but some of them might seem superfluous. Some suggestions for the ones that seem extra: 110 Face Shape for cream contour, 122 Petit Stippling for targeted bronzer, 101 Luxe Face Definer for diffused bronzer, 109 Luxe Face Paint for powder contour and 125 Stippling for light liquid foundation or tinted moisturizer.Overall, this is a LOVELY comprehensive brush set! I've had them about a month. The eye brushes are especially impressive. You can do any look with this range! The synthetic face brushes rival Zoeva quality, except the Z ones are heavier without sparkles on handle but who cares. The white hair brushes are also very good. All brushes are dense, so soft, great blending, don't leave streaks, solid construction. These Jessup brushes are a STEAL. You can find cheaper brush sets on Amazon, but they will be synthetic bristles. These are some very good quality brushes. 10/10 recommend.","Reviewed in Germany on 10 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2448","Jessup-Professional-Foundation-eyelashes-Natural-Synthetic","The ONLY Review You Need to Read! GET IT!!","MH","If you‚Äôre a cheapo that likes high quality things such as myself, THESE BRUSHES ARE PERFECT. They are VERY comparable to Morphe Brushes, and dare I say, these Jessup brushes are even BETTER. They‚Äôre soft without feeling plastic-y (only one really had a ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù feel to it, which is the 125 Stippling brush) and they apply makeup better than a lot of higher-end brushes that I‚Äôve tried in the past. I got the color in Blushing Bride and they are absolutely beautiful! All of the brushes come individually packaged in a plastic wrapper; the bigger, fluffier brushes have a net-like thing on the bristles which protects them (only 24 brushes are shown in the picture because one brush had rolled under my leg, so none were missing). I‚Äôve seen reviews complaining about a hair or two being out of place, but personally, I see no issue in that; none of my brushes were shedding or fuzzy-looking.I‚Äôm not a picky person, but if YOUR brushes don‚Äôt come in in tip-top shape, send them back and get a new batch because these are worth it despite any minor flaw!!I only used 7 of the 25 brushes to apply my makeup for the look I created in these pictures for my everyday routine. I used all of my same products; however, I did not apply or blend my foundation with any of the brushes *out of preference*, so I CAN‚ÄôT say how these brushes would handle blending liquid foundation.Brushes Used:I used the 105 Luxe Highlight brush to apply my setting/baking powder (as shown in the second picture), and it picked up my Fenty Beauty setting powder really well and applied just how I wanted it to.110 Face Shape brush: Essence powder contour around face and nose- this brush is super small to be contouring or bronzing the cheeks, but none of the others seemed to be the right shape or density besides the brush I had already used to apply my blush.127 Luxe Sheer Cheek brush: NARS powder blush- this one didn‚Äôt apply my blush exactly how I liked, so I would simply use a different brush next time. This one would‚Äôve been the better cheek contour brush for its shape.322 Brow Liner: brows using ABH dip brow pomade- was a bit big for applying this product, so next time I would swap it out for the 312 Detail Liner brush (disclaimer: none of these eye brushes have a ‚Äúspoolie‚Äù to brush and blend out brow products)228 Luxe Crease, 227 Luxe Soft Definer, and 226 Smudger brushes: eyeshadow with my GlamLite Chocolate Donut Palette and The Chocolates Palette by Juvia‚Äôs Place- these eyeshadow brushes really knocked everything out of the park even though I only used 3 of the 15 EYE brushes in this 25pc set.Keep in mind to not rely solely on pictures of how makeup applied for others in reviews because makeup primer, brand, and skills OR lack of those things can affect how these brushes will APPEAR to perform.All of the brushes are different so DON‚ÄôT expect multiples; if you do lots of colorful eyeshadow looks very often, I would purchase this set along with Jessup‚Äôs brush set that comes with JUST the 15 or 18 eye brushes which is $25.99 if I‚Äôm remembering correctly.I cannot say for certain how these brushes would hold up during a wash because I try not to wash my makeup brushes as often as I should, but these are SO nice that I wouldn‚Äôt even mind if they got a little bit beat up because I would keep using them and continue buying more. These would be an amazing gift to anyone that has a love for makeup or even anyone that is a beginner in the makeup world.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 March 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2500","Concealer-Foundation-Applicator-maquillaje-profesional","Excellent brush replaces your finger.","De Anna","But why would you need a brush if you could just use your finger???
