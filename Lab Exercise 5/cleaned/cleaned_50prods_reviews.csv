"1231","nyx-professional-makeup-brightening-primer","super matte  not for the faint of heart","alicia r","alright so i just received this and am gonna list my thoughts on a first impression basisit has the look and consistency of very thick petroleum jelly to the point where it takes a bit of muscle to squeeze out of the tube i got a bit skeptical because ive used clear primers in the past the smashbox one and maybelline master prime that havent lived up to their claims of blurring pores and making your makeup last i also was thinking it may be difficult to spread evenly over the skin since its sooo thiccccc but just like with petroleum jelly once it hits the warmth of your skin it just melts into a much more malleable consistencythis is when the stuff starts to behave very differently from your everyday vaselineinstead of sitting on top of your skin in a layer of grease it fully absorbs into your pores and any trace of oil or moisture is gone so are your pores the skin on my face literally feels tightthat being said whoo be carefuli have hyperhidrosis aka excessive sweating especially from my head and face which is like the suckiest thing ever  and the reason i mention it is because i have tried antiperspirant face lotions that feel a lot like this i couldnt find a list of ingredients on the package but if i had to guess i would say that this stuff contains aluminum maybe even a lot of it which will clog your pores and form a barrier between your skin and the oxygen in other words if you are super oily and acneprone like i used to be this will help control it for a special occasion here and there but will make your skin  worse in the long run if you use it on a regular basis  again thats only my first impression but if your skin does not take kindly to strange new cosmetic formulas i would use this stuff very sparinglymy skin does get noticeably more oily in the summer and i usually love a matte primer but this is the first time i felt like a product made my skin look dried out and wrinkled i bought it thinking it would help my makeup wear longer i had no expectations that it would be so matte and blurring im shook if you cant tell loloverall  i really really like this primer and if i had to bet i would say its going to keep my makeup in place  longer than any other ive tried but its also a weapon you must use with caution lol",2021-06-10,4,"verified purchase"
