"3","climate immobility traps: a household-level test","marco letta, pierluigi montalbano, adriana paolantonio","general economics","the complex relationship between climate shocks, migration, and adaptation hampers a rigorous understanding of the heterogeneous mobility outcomes of farm households exposed to climate risk. to unpack this heterogeneity, the analysis combines longitudinal multi-topic household survey data from nigeria with a causal machine learning approach, tailored to a conceptual framework bridging economic migration theory and the poverty traps literature. the results show that pre-shock asset levels, in situ adaptive capacity, and cumulative shock exposure drive not just the magnitude but also the sign of the impact of agriculture-relevant weather anomalies on the mobility outcomes of farming households. while local adaptation acts as a substitute for migration, the roles played by wealth constraints and repeated shock exposure suggest the presence of climate-induced immobility traps.",2024-03-14

our proposal to address this challenge is to minimize packet loss by jointly optimizing the velocity controls and data collection schedules of multiple uavs.furthermore, in uasnets, swift movements of uavs result in poor channel conditions and fast signal attenuation, leading to an extended age of information (aoi). in contrast, slow movements of uavs prolong flight time, thereby extending the aoi of ground this http url address this challenge, we propose a new mean-field flight resource allocation optimization to minimize the aoi of sensory data.",2023-12-15

"145","multi-agricultural machinery collaborative task assignment based on improved genetic hybrid optimization algorithm","haohao du","neural and evolutionary computing","to address the challenges of delayed scheduling information, heavy reliance on manual labour, and low operational efficiency in traditional large-scale agricultural machinery operations, this study proposes a method for multi-agricultural machinery collaborative task assignment based on an improved genetic hybrid optimisation algorithm. the proposed method establishes a multi-agricultural machinery task allocation model by combining the path pre-planning of a simulated annealing algorithm and the static task allocation of a genetic algorithm. by sequentially fusing these two algorithms, their respective shortcomings can be overcome, and their advantages in global and local search can be utilised. consequently, the search capability of the population is enhanced, leading to the discovery of more optimal solutions. then, an adaptive crossover operator is constructed according to the task assignment model, considering the capacity, path cost, and time of agricultural machinery; two-segment coding and multi-population adaptive mutation are used to assign tasks to improve the diversity of the population and enhance the exploration ability of the population; and to improve the global optimisation ability of the hybrid algorithm, a 2-opt local optimisation operator and an circle modification algorithm are introduced. finally, simulation experiments were conducted in matlab to evaluate the performance of the multi-agricultural machinery collaborative task assignment based on the improved genetic hybrid algorithm. the algorithm's capabilities were assessed through comparative analysis in the simulation trials. the results demonstrate that the developed hybrid algorithm can effectively reduce path costs, and the efficiency of the assignment outcomes surpasses that of the classical genetic algorithm. this approach proves particularly suitable for addressing large-scale task allocation problems.",2023-12-07
