However, the continuity of such time series is often disrupted by clouds. In response to this challenge, we propose a deep learning method that integrates cloud-free optical (Sentinel-2) observations and weather-independent (Sentinel-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, using a combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to generate continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. We emphasize the significance of observation continuity by assessing the impact of the generated time series on the detection of grassland mowing events. We focus on Lithuania, a country characterized by extensive cloud coverage, and compare our approach with alternative interpolation techniques (i.e., linear, Akima, quadratic). Our method surpasses these techniques, with an average MAE of 0.024 and R^2 of 0.92. It not only improves the accuracy of event detection tasks by employing a continuous time series, but also effectively filters out sudden shifts and noise originating from cloudy observations that cloud masks often fail to detect.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 16:41:26 UTC (17,639 KB)"
"2","A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Dairy Farm Battery Management using Q Learning","Nawazish Ali, Abdul Wahid, Rachael Shaw, Karl Mason","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Dairy farming consumes a significant amount of energy, making it an energy-intensive sector within agriculture. Integrating renewable energy generation into dairy farming could help address this challenge. Effective battery management is important for integrating renewable energy generation. Managing battery charging and discharging poses significant challenges because of fluctuations in electrical consumption, the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation, and fluctuations in energy prices. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly improve the use of renewable energy in dairy farming, however, there is limited research conducted in this particular domain. This research considers Ireland as a case study as it works towards attaining its 2030 energy strategy centered on the utilization of renewable sources. This study proposes a Q-learning-based algorithm for scheduling battery charging and discharging in a dairy farm setting. This research also explores the effect of the proposed algorithm by adding wind generation data and considering additional case studies. The proposed algorithm reduces the cost of imported electricity from the grid by 13.41\%, peak demand by 2\%, and 24.49\% when utilizing wind generation. These results underline how reinforcement learning is highly effective in managing batteries in the dairy farming sector.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 15:42:26 UTC (3,808 KB)"
"3","Climate Immobility Traps: A Household-Level Test","Marco Letta, Pierluigi Montalbano, Adriana Paolantonio","General Economics (econ.GN)","The complex relationship between climate shocks, migration, and adaptation hampers a rigorous understanding of the heterogeneous mobility outcomes of farm households exposed to climate risk. To unpack this heterogeneity, the analysis combines longitudinal multi-topic household survey data from Nigeria with a causal machine learning approach, tailored to a conceptual framework bridging economic migration theory and the poverty traps literature. The results show that pre-shock asset levels, in situ adaptive capacity, and cumulative shock exposure drive not just the magnitude but also the sign of the impact of agriculture-relevant weather anomalies on the mobility outcomes of farming households. While local adaptation acts as a substitute for migration, the roles played by wealth constraints and repeated shock exposure suggest the presence of climate-induced immobility traps.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 15:09:04 UTC (873 KB)"
"4","The indoor agriculture industry: a promising player in demand response services","Javier Penuela, Cecile Ben, Stepan Boldyrev, Laurent Gentzbittel, Henni Ouerdane","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","Demand response (DR) programs currently cover about 2\% of the average annual global demand, which is far from contributing to the International Energy Agency's ``Net Zero by 2050'' roadmap's 20\% target. While aggregation of many small flexible loads such as individual households can help reaching this target, increasing the participation of industries that are major electricity consumers is certainly a way forward. The indoor agriculture sector currently experiences a significant growth to partake in the sustainable production of high-quality food world-wide. As energy-related costs, up to 40\% of the total expenses, may preclude full maturity of this industry, DR participation can result in a win-win situation. Indeed, the agriculture system must transform and become a sustainable source of food for an increasing number of people worldwide under the constraints of preservation of soils and water, carbon footprint, and energy efficiency. We considered the case of the Russian Federation where indoor farming is burgeoning and already represents a load of several thousand megawatts. To show the viability of the indoor farming industry participation in implicit and explicit DR programs, we built a physical model of a vertical farm inside a phytotron with complete control of environmental parameters including ambient temperature, relative humidity, CO$_2$ concentration, and photosynthetic photon flux density. This phytotron was used as a model greenhouse. We grew different varieties of leafy plants under simulated DR conditions and control conditions on the same setup. Our results show that the indoor farming dedicated to greens can participate in DR without adversely affecting plant production and that this presents an economic advantage.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 20:02:35 UTC (1,537 KB)"

"6","The Effect of Different Optimization Strategies to Physics-Constrained Deep Learning for Soil Moisture Estimation","Jianxin Xie, Bing Yao, Zheyu Jiang","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Soil moisture is a key hydrological parameter that has significant importance to human society and the environment. Accurate modeling and monitoring of soil moisture in crop fields, especially in the root zone (top 100 cm of soil), is essential for improving agricultural production and crop yield with the help of precision irrigation and farming tools. Realizing the full sensor data potential depends greatly on advanced analytical and predictive domain-aware models. In this work, we propose a physics-constrained deep learning (P-DL) framework to integrate physics-based principles on water transport and water sensing signals for effective reconstruction of the soil moisture dynamics. We adopt three different optimizers, namely Adam, RMSprop, and GD, to minimize the loss function of P-DL during the training process. In the illustrative case study, we demonstrate the empirical convergence of Adam optimizers outperforms the other optimization methods in both mini-batch and full-batch training.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 00:32:30 UTC (1,955 KB)"
"7","RoboCertProb: Property Specification for Probabilistic RoboChart Models","Kangfeng Ye, Jim Woodcock","Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)","RoboChart is a core notation in the RoboStar framework which brings modern modelling and formal verification technologies into software engineering for robotics. It is a timed and probabilistic domain-specific language for robotics and provides a UML-like architectural and state machine modelling. This work presents RoboCertProb for specifying quantitative properties of probabilistic robotic systems modelled in RoboChart. RoboCertProb's semantics is based on PCTL*. To interpret RoboCertProb over RoboChart models, we give a Markov semantics (DTMCs and MDPs) to RoboChart, derived from its existing transformation semantics to the PRISM language. In addition to property specification, RoboCertProb also entitles us to configure loose constants and unspecified functions and operations in RoboChart models. It allows us to set up environmental inputs to verify reactive probabilistic systems not directly supported in probabilistic model checkers like PRISM because they employ a closed-world assumption. We implement RoboCertProb in an accompanying tool of RoboChart, RoboTool, for specifying properties and automatically generating PRISM properties from them to formally verify RoboChart models using PRISM. We have used it to analyse the behaviour of software controllers for two real robots: an industrial painting robot and an agricultural robot for treating plants with UV lights.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 23:47:00 UTC (1,188 KB)"

Considering this aspect, this manuscript reviews disclosed and documented cybersecurity incidents in the FA sector. For this purpose, thirty cybersecurity incidents were identified, which took place between July 2011 and April 2023. The details of these incidents are reported from multiple sources such as: the private industry and flash notifications generated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), internal reports from the affected organizations, and available media sources. Considering the available information, a brief description of the security threat, ransom amount, and impact on the organization are discussed for each incident. This review reports an increased frequency of cybersecurity threats to the FA sector. To minimize these cyber risks, popular cybersecurity frameworks and recent agriculture-specific cybersecurity solutions are also discussed. Further, the need for AI assurance in the FA sector is explained, and the Farmer-Centered AI (FCAI) framework is proposed. The main aim of the FCAI framework is to support farmers in decision-making for agricultural production, by incorporating AI assurance. Lastly, the effects of the reported cyber incidents on other critical infrastructures, food security, and the economy are noted, along with specifying the open issues for future development.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 19:15:20 UTC (698 KB)"

This study aims to investigate whether machine learning-based yield prediction models can capably predict Kharif season rice yields at the district level in India several months before the rice harvest takes place. The methodology involved training 19 machine learning models such as CatBoost, LightGBM, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, and Extremely Randomized Trees on 20 years of climate, satellite, and rice yield data across 247 of Indian rice-producing districts. In addition to model-building, a dynamic dashboard was built understand how the reliability of rice yield predictions varies across districts. The results of the proof-of-concept machine learning pipeline demonstrated that rice yields can be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy, with out-of-sample R2, MAE, and MAPE performance of up to 0.82, 0.29, and 0.16 respectively. These results outperformed test set performance reported in related literature on rice yield modeling in other contexts and countries. In addition, SHAP value analysis was conducted to infer both the importance and directional impact of the climate and remote sensing variables included in the model. Important features driving rice yields included temperature, soil water volume, and leaf area index. In particular, higher temperatures in August correlate with increased rice yields, particularly when the leaf area index in August is also high. Building on the results, a proof-of-concept dashboard was developed to allow users to easily explore which districts may experience a rise or fall in yield relative to the previous year.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 13:31:13 UTC (4,413 KB)"

This review examines various farming practices and their impact on soil organic carbon storage. After a careful review of the literature, most of the research indicated that different farming practices, such as organic farming, cover crops, conservation tillage, and agroforestry, play vital roles in increasing the SOC content of the soil sustainably. Root exudation from cover crops increases microbial activity and helps break down complex organic compounds into organic carbon. Conservation tillage enhances the soil structure and maintains carbon storage without disturbing the soil. Agroforestry systems boost organic carbon input and fasten nutrient cycling because the trees and crops have symbiotic relationships. Intercropping and crop rotations have a role in changing the composition of plant residues and promoting carbon storage. There were many understanding on the complex interactions between soil organic carbon dynamics and agricultural practices. Based on the study, the paper reveals, the role of different agricultural practices like Carbon storage through cover crops, crop rotation, mulching Conservation tillage, conventional tillage, zero tillage and organic amendments in organic carbon storage in the soil for maximum crop yield to improve the economic condition of the cultivators.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 11:06:56 UTC (782 KB)"

At the core of this software is the ability to translate geophysical data into specific soil properties (and vice-versa) using pedophysical models (PM). Pedophysical modelling techniques offer valuable insights into various realms including precision agriculture, soil health, resource prospecting, nutrient and land management, hydrogeology, and heritage conservation. In developing a tool for pedophysical modelling, some challenges emerged: selecting suitable PMs from the extensive literature, adapting these to specific conditions, and ensuring adequate data availability. While addressing these, we designed an automated workflow that implements robust PMs (selected after a throughout review), apply different modelling approaches based on soil characteristics and targeted properties, and employs pedotransfer functions and assumptions to integrate missing soil data into PMs. The capabilities of Pedophysics extend to handling complex scenarios such as fusing data from different instruments, incorporating continuous monitoring measurements, and soil calibration data. With these solutions, Pedophysics automates the process of deriving targeted soil and geophysical properties with state-of-art accuracy. Hereby, users can rely on Pedophysics to implement specific knowledge about pedophysical modeling. The software promotes global access to advanced soil geophysical solutions by being open-source and encouraging community contributions. Pedophysics is written in pure Python and has minimal dependencies. It can be easily installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI).","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:09:53 UTC (1,066 KB)"
"12","Physics-constrained Active Learning for Soil Moisture Estimation and Optimal Sensor Placement","Jianxin Xie, Bing Yao, Zheyu Jiang","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","Soil moisture is a crucial hydrological state variable that has significant importance to the global environment and agriculture. Precise monitoring of soil moisture in crop fields is critical to reducing agricultural drought and improving crop yield. In-situ soil moisture sensors, which are buried at pre-determined depths and distributed across the field, are promising solutions for monitoring soil moisture. However, high-density sensor deployment is neither economically feasible nor practical. Thus, to achieve a higher spatial resolution of soil moisture dynamics using a limited number of sensors, we integrate a physics-based agro-hydrological model based on Richards' equation in a physics-constrained deep learning framework to accurately predict soil moisture dynamics in the soil's root zone. This approach ensures that soil moisture estimates align well with sensor observations while obeying physical laws at the same time. Furthermore, to strategically identify the locations for sensor placement, we introduce a novel active learning framework that combines space-filling design and physics residual-based sampling to maximize data acquisition potential with limited sensors. Our numerical results demonstrate that integrating Physics-constrained Deep Learning (P-DL) with an active learning strategy within a unified framework--named the Physics-constrained Active Learning (P-DAL) framework--significantly improves the predictive accuracy and effectiveness of field-scale soil moisture monitoring using in-situ sensors.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:45:34 UTC (1,655 KB)"

Addressing this challenge, our study develops an operationally-ready model for predicting locust breeding grounds, which has the potential to enhance early warning systems and targeted control measures. We curated a dataset from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (UN-FAO) locust observation records and analyzed it using two types of spatio-temporal input features: remotely-sensed environmental and climate data as well as multi-spectral earth observation images. Our approach employed custom deep learning models (three-dimensional and LSTM-based recurrent convolutional networks), along with the geospatial foundational model Prithvi recently released by Jakubik et al., 2023. These models notably outperformed existing baselines, with the Prithvi-based model, fine-tuned on multi-spectral images from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, achieving the highest accuracy, F1 and ROC-AUC scores (83.03%, 81.53% and 87.69%, respectively). A significant finding from our research is that multi-spectral earth observation images alone are sufficient for effective locust breeding ground prediction without the need to explicitly incorporate climatic or environmental features.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 16:13:58 UTC (7,006 KB)"

Leveraging its capability to penetrate through heterogeneous environments MIS has been widely used for subsurface imaging. Monitoring subsurface drip irrigation(SDI) as an efficient procedure in agricultural irrigation is essential to maintain the required moisture percentage for plant growth which is a novel MIS application. In this research, we implement a laboratory-scale MIS for SDI reflecting real-world conditions to evaluate leakage localization and quantification in a heterogeneous area. We extract a model to quantify the moisture content by exploiting an imaging approach that could be used in a scheduled SDI. We employ the subspace information of images formed by back projection and Born approximation algorithms for model parametrization and estimate the model parameters using a statistical curve fitting technique. We then compare the performance of these imaging techniques in the presence of environmental clutter such as plant roots and pebbles. The proposed approach can well contribute to efficient mechanistic subsurface irrigation for which the local moisture around the root is obtained noninvasively and remotely with less than 20% estimation error.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 21:38:17 UTC (10,131 KB)"

Many studies have confirmed agricultural diversification practices such as intercropping, organic farming and soil inoculations as a suitable pathway to achieve these goals, but long-term viability of socioeconomic and ecological benefits is uncertain. Here, we quantified the long-term effects of agricultural diversification practices on socioeconomic and ecological benefits based on 50 years of data from 184 meta-analyses and 4,260 effect sizes. We showed that, with neutral crop yield over time, financial profitability, most variables related to biological communities, all aspects of soil quality, and carbon sequestration benefits increased by up to 2823% over 20 years of practice. Non-crop diversification practices and the use of organic amendments increased benefits by up to 2000% after 50 years. A trade-off analysis between yield and other services showed win-win outcomes during the first 25 years. Our synthesis provides the urgently needed evidence for farmers and other decision-makers that diversification increases long-term profitability, biodiversity, and climate mitigation benefits, and therefore, allows upscaling diversification for climate change mitigation and global food system transformation.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 22:14:15 UTC (3,537 KB)"

Thus, for the first time, we evaluated the lethal, sublethal and transgerational effects of six insecticides used in the management of stink bug complex in soybean crops on the different life stages of the parasitoid Telenomus podisi (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) in three temperature levels (15, 25 and 30 °C). Telenomus podisi adults (F0 generation), when exposed to insecticides based on acephate, spinosad and thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin, showed accumulated mortality of 100% at all temperature levels tested. On the other hand, methoxyfenozide + spinetoram caused average mortalities of 88.75% at 15 °C and 38.75% at 25 and 30 °C. In contrast, the mortality rates caused by chlorfenapyr at 15, 25 and 30 °C were 1.25, 71.25 and 71.25%. On the other hand, surviving adults in lethal toxicity bioassay did not show differences in egg parasitism (F0 generation) and emergence of F1 generation in all temperature levels studied; however, the insecticide methoxyfenozide + spinetoram showed the lowest level of parasitism and emergence of T. podisi. In addition, our results demonstrated significant changes in the proportion of emerged males and females as the temperature increased; however, we did not find any differences when comparing the insecticides studied. Furthermore, we detected a significant interaction between insecticides and temperatures by contaminating the host's parasitized eggs (parasitoid pupal stage). Generally, the highest emergence reduction values were found at the highest temperature studied (30 °C). Our results highlighted the temperature-dependent impact of synthetic insecticides on parasitoids, which should be considered in toxicological risk assessments and under predicted climate change scenarios.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 17:43:13 UTC (604 KB)"

Whilst related research contributes to enabling TinyML solutions on constrained hardware, there is a need to amplify real-world applications by optimising energy consumption in battery-powered systems. The work presented extends and contributes to TinyML research by optimising battery-powered image-based anomaly detection Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Whilst previous work in this area has yielded the capabilities of on-device inferencing and training, there has yet to be an investigation into optimising the management of such capabilities using machine learning approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), to improve the deployment battery life of such systems. Using modelled simulations, the battery life effects of an RL algorithm are benchmarked against static and dynamic optimisation approaches, with the foundation laid for a hardware benchmark to follow. It is shown that using RL within a TinyML-enabled IoT system to optimise the system operations, including cloud anomaly processing and on-device training, yields an improved battery life of 22.86% and 10.86% compared to static and dynamic optimisation approaches respectively. The proposed solution can be deployed to resource-constrained hardware, given its low memory footprint of 800 B, which could be further reduced.

Abiotic factors such as pH, nutrient availability, and soil composition significantly affect root morphology and architecture. Of particular interest is the impact of nutrient flow on thigmomorphogenesis, a response to mechanical stimulation in early root growth, which remains largely unexplored. This study explores the intricate factors influencing early root system development, with a focus on the cooperative correlation between nutrient uptake and its flow dynamics. Using physiologically relevant, portable, and cost-effective microfluidic system for the controlled fluid environments offering hydraulic conductivity comparable to that of the soil, this study analyzes the interplay between nutrient flow and root growth post-germination. Emphasizing the relationship between root growth and nitrogen uptake, the findings reveal that nutrient flow significantly influences early root morphology, leading to increased length and improved nutrient uptake, varying with the flow rate. The experimental findings are supported by stress-related fluid flow-root interaction simulations and quantitative determination of nitrogen uptake using the Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) method. The microfluidic approach offers novel insights into plant root dynamics under controlled flow conditions, filling a critical research gap. By providing a high-resolution platform, this study contributes to the understanding of how fluid-flow assisted nutrient uptake and pressure affect root-cell behavior, which, in turn, induces mechanical stress leading to thigmomorphogenesis.

Traditionally, analyzing global food prices and their associations with socioeconomic factors has relied on static linear regression models. However, the complexity of socioeconomic factors and their implications extend beyond simple linear relationships. By incorporating determinants, critical characteristics identification, and comparative model analysis, this study aimed to identify the critical socioeconomic characteristics and multidimensional relationships associated with the underlying factors of food prices and security. Machine learning tools were used to uncover the socioeconomic factors influencing global food prices from 2000 to 2022. A total of 105 key variables from the World Development Indicators and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations were selected. Machine learning identified four key dimensions of food price security: economic and population metrics, military spending, health spending, and environmental factors. The top 30 determinants were selected for feature extraction using data mining. The efficiency of the support vector regression model allowed for precise prediction making and correlation analysis.

These concerns have sparked interest in applying different techniques to determine reservoir operation policy decisions. As the resolution of the analysis increases, it becomes more difficult to effectively represent a real-world system using traditional methods such as Dynamic Programming (DP) and Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) for determining the best reservoir operation policy. One of the challenges is the ""curse of dimensionality,"" which means the number of samples needed to estimate an arbitrary function with a given level of accuracy grows exponentially with respect to the number of input variables (i.e., dimensionality) of the function. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is an intelligent approach to overcome the curses of stochastic optimization problems for reservoir operation policy decisions. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt that examine various novel DRL continuous-action policy gradient methods (PGMs), including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3), and two different versions of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC18 and SAC19) for optimizing reservoir operation policy. In this study, multiple DRL techniques were implemented in order to find the optimal operation policy of Folsom Reservoir in California, USA. The reservoir system supplies agricultural, municipal, hydropower, and environmental flow demands and flood control operations to the City of Sacramento. Analysis suggests that the TD3 and SAC are robust to meet the Folsom Reservoir's demands and optimize reservoir operation policies.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 03:55:56 UTC (2,842 KB)"

However, the reliance on herbicide application not only poses a critical threat to the environment but also promotes the emergence of resistant weeds. Fortunately, recent advances in precision weed management enabled by ML and DL provide a sustainable alternative. Despite great progress, existing algorithms are mainly developed based on supervised learning approaches, which typically demand large-scale datasets with manual-labeled annotations, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As such, label-efficient learning methods, especially semi-supervised learning, have gained increased attention in the broader domain of computer vision and have demonstrated promising performance. These methods aim to utilize a small number of labeled data samples along with a great number of unlabeled samples to develop high-performing models comparable to the supervised learning counterpart trained on a large amount of labeled data samples. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a semi-supervised learning framework for multi-class weed detection, employing two well-known object detection frameworks, namely FCOS and Faster-RCNN. Specifically, we evaluate a generalized student-teacher framework with an improved pseudo-label generation module to produce reliable pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. To enhance generalization, an ensemble student network is employed to facilitate the training process. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve approximately 76\% and 96\% detection accuracy as the supervised methods with only 10\% of labeled data in CottenWeedDet3 and CottonWeedDet12, respectively.

"24","The vehicle routing problem with synchronization constraints and support vehicle-dependent service times","David Wittwer, Felix Tamke","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","Many production processes require the cooperation of various resources. Especially when using expensive machines, their utilization plays a decisive role in efficient production. In agricultural production or civil construction processes, e.g., harvesting or road building, the machines are typically mobile, and synchronization of different machine types is required to perform operations. In addition, the productivity of one type often depends on the availability of another type. In this paper, we consider two types of vehicles, called primary and support vehicles. Primary vehicles perform operations and are assisted by at least one support vehicle, with more support vehicles resulting in faster service times for primary vehicles. We call this practical problem the vehicle routing and scheduling problem with support vehicle-dependent service times and introduce two mixed-integer linear programming models. The first represents each support vehicle individually with binary decision variables, while the second considers the cumulative flow of support vehicles with integer decision variables. Furthermore, the models are defined on a graph that allows easy transformation into multiple variants. These variants are based on allowing or prohibiting switching support vehicles between primary vehicles and splitting services among primary vehicles. We show in our extensive computational experiments that: i) the integer representation of support vehicles is superior to the binary representation, ii) the benefit of additional vehicles is subject to saturation effects and depends on the ratio of support and primary vehicles, and iii) switching and splitting lead to problems that are more difficult to solve, but also result in better solutions with higher primary vehicle utilization.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 22:46:35 UTC (767 KB)"

With economic globalization and the financialization of agricultural products continuing to advance, the interconnections between different agricultural futures have become closer. We utilize a TVP-VAR-DY model combined with the quantile method to measure the risk spillover between 11 agricultural futures on the futures exchanges of US and China from July 9,2014, to December 31,2022. This study yielded several significant findings. Firstly, CBOT corn, soybean, and wheat were identified as the primary risk transmitters, with DCE corn and soybean as the main risk receivers. Secondly, sudden events or increased economic uncertainty can increase the overall risk spillovers. Thirdly, there is an aggregation of risk spillovers amongst agricultural futures based on the dynamic directional spillover results. Lastly, the central agricultural futures under the conditional mean are CBOT corn and soybean, while CZCE hard wheat and long-grained rice are the two risk spillover centers in extreme cases, as per the results of the spillover network and minimum spanning tree. Based on these results, decision-makers are advised to safeguard against the price risk of agricultural futures under sudden economic events, and investors can utilize the results to construct a superior investment portfolio by taking different agricultural product futures as risk-leading indicators according to various situations.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 05:44:15 UTC (7,113 KB)"
"26","The Grasp Loop Signature: A Topological Representation for Manipulation Planning with Ropes and Cables","Peter Mitrano, Dmitry Berenson","Robotics (cs.RO)","Robotic manipulation of deformable, one-dimensional objects (DOOs) like ropes or cables has important potential applications in manufacturing, agriculture, and surgery. In such environments, the task may involve threading through or avoiding becoming tangled with objects like racks or frames. Grasping with multiple grippers can create closed loops between the robot and DOO, and If an obstacle lies within this loop, it may be impossible to reach the goal. However, prior work has only considered the topology of the DOO in isolation, ignoring the arms that are manipulating it. Searching over possible grasps to accomplish the task without considering such topological information is very inefficient, as many grasps will not lead to progress on the task due to topological constraints. Therefore, we propose a grasp loop signature which categorizes the topology of these grasp loops and show how it can be used to guide planning. We perform experiments in simulation on two DOO manipulation tasks to show that using the signature is faster and succeeds more often than methods that rely on local geometry or finite-horizon planning. Finally, we demonstrate using the signature in the real world to manipulate a cable in a scene with obstacles using a dual-arm robot.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 20:37:27 UTC (4,962 KB)"

Developers of tools for performing high-throughput phenotyping are, however, constrained by the availability of relevant datasets on which to perform validation. To this end, we present a spatio-temporal dataset of 3D point clouds of strawberry plants for two varieties, totalling 84 individual point clouds. We focus on the end use of such tools - the extraction of biologically relevant phenotypes - and demonstrate a phenotyping pipeline on the dataset. This comprises of the steps, including; segmentation, skeletonisation and tracking, and we detail how each stage facilitates the extraction of different phenotypes or provision of data insights. We particularly note that assessment is focused on the validation of phenotypes, extracted from the representations acquired at each step of the pipeline, rather than singularly focusing on assessing the representation itself. Therefore, where possible, we provide \textit{in silico} ground truth baselines for the phenotypes extracted at each step and introduce methodology for the quantitative assessment of skeletonisation and the length trait extracted thereof. This dataset contributes to the corpus of freely available agricultural/horticultural spatio-temporal data for the development of next-generation phenotyping tools, increasing the number of plant varieties available for research in this field and providing a basis for genuine comparison of new phenotyping methodology.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 14:44:05 UTC (19,885 KB)"

Rothrock Jr., Bindu Nanduri, Zhiqian Chen, Mahalingam Ramkumar","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Understanding how multiple features are associated and contribute to a specific objective is as important as understanding how each feature contributes to a particular outcome. Interpretability of a single feature in a prediction may be handled in multiple ways; however, in a multi-objective prediction, it is difficult to obtain interpretability of a combination of feature values. To address this issue, we propose an objective specific feature interaction design using multi-labels to find the optimal combination of features in agricultural settings. One of the novel aspects of this design is the identification of a method that integrates feature explanations with global sensitivity analysis in order to ensure combinatorial optimization in multi-objective settings. We have demonstrated in our preliminary experiments that an approximate combination of feature values can be found to achieve the desired outcome using two agricultural datasets: one with pre-harvest poultry farm practices for multi-drug resistance presence, and one with post-harvest poultry farm practices for food-borne pathogens. In our combinatorial optimization approach, all three pathogens are taken into consideration simultaneously to account for the interaction between conditions that favor different types of pathogen growth. These results indicate that explanation-based approaches are capable of identifying combinations of features that reduce pathogen presence in fewer iterations than a baseline.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 02:24:04 UTC (5,216 KB)"

This study frames the search for optimal management practices that minimize the presence of multiple pathogens as a combinatorial optimization problem. Specifically, we model the various possible combinations of management settings as a solution space that can be efficiently explored to identify configurations that optimally reduce pathogen levels. This design incorporates a neural network feedback-based method that combines feature explanations with global sensitivity analysis to ensure combinatorial optimization in multiobjective settings. Our preliminary experiments have promising results when applied to two real-world agricultural datasets.

Hardin, Nithya Rajan","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Radiometric accuracy of data is crucial in quantitative precision agriculture, to produce reliable and repeatable data for modeling and decision making. The effect of exposure time and gain settings on the radiometric accuracy of multispectral images was not explored enough. The goal of this study was to determine if having a fixed exposure (FE) time during image acquisition improved radiometric accuracy of images, compared to the default auto-exposure (AE) settings. This involved quantifying the errors from auto-exposure and determining ideal exposure values within which radiometric mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were minimal (< 5%). The results showed that FE orthomosaic was closer to ground-truth (higher R2 and lower MAPE) than AE orthomosaic. An ideal exposure range was determined for capturing canopy and soil objects, without loss of information from under-exposure or saturation from over-exposure. A simulation of errors from AE showed that MAPE < 5% for the blue, green, red, and NIR bands and < 7% for the red edge band for exposure settings within the determined ideal ranges and increased exponentially beyond the ideal exposure upper limit. Further, prediction of total plant nitrogen uptake (g/plant) using vegetation indices (VIs) from two different growing seasons were closer to the ground truth (mostly, R2 > 0.40, and MAPE = 12 to 14%, p < 0.05) when FE was used, compared to the prediction from AE images (mostly, R2 < 0.13, MAPE = 15 to 18%, p >= 0.05).","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 18:35:59 UTC (1,772 KB)"

The framework incorporates several key stages to enhance disease recognition accuracy. In the pre-processing phase, a thumbnail resizing technique is employed to resize images, minimizing the loss of critical image details while ensuring computational efficiency. Normalization procedures are applied to standardize image data before feature extraction. Feature extraction is facilitated through a novel framework built upon Vision Transformers, a state-of-the-art approach in image analysis. Additionally, alternative versions of the framework with an added layer of linear projection and blockwise linear projections are explored. This comparative analysis allows for the evaluation of the impact of linear projection on feature extraction and overall model performance. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework, various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are utilized, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of linear projection's influence on key evaluation metrics. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, with the top-performing model achieving a Hamming loss of 0.054.

Compared to previous version, the model can process InSAR stacks of variable time steps and select both persistent (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS). We trained the model on ~20,000 training images (interferograms), each of size 100 by 100 pixels, extracted from InSAR time series interferograms containing both artificial features (buildings and infrastructure) and objects of natural environment (vegetation, forests, barren or agricultural land, water bodies). Based on such categorization, we developed two deep learning models, primarily focusing on urban and coastal sites. Training labels were generated from elite pixel selection outputs generated from the wavelet-based InSAR (WabInSAR) software developed by Shirzaei (2013) and improved in Lee and Shirzaei (2023). With 4 urban and 7 coastal sites used for training and validation, the predicted elite pixel selection maps reveal that the proposed models efficiently learn from WabInSAR-generated labels, reaching a validation accuracy of 94%. The models accurately discard pixels affected by geometric and temporal decorrelation while selecting pixels corresponding to urban objects and those with stable phase history unaffected by temporal and geometric decorrelation. The density of pixels in urban areas is comparable to and higher for coastal areas compared to WabInSAR outputs. With significantly reduced time computation (order of minutes) and improved selection of elite pixels, the proposed models can efficiently process long InSAR time series stacks and generate rapid deformation maps.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 23:11:24 UTC (1,267 KB)"

As off-the-shelf MLLMs may have limited capabilities on images from domains like dermatology and agriculture, they must be fine-tuned to unlock domain-specific applications. The prevalent architecture of current open-source MLLMs comprises two major modules: an image-language (cross-modal) projection network and a large language model. It is desirable to understand the roles of these two modules in modeling domain-specific visual attributes to inform the design of future models and streamline the interpretability efforts on the current models. To this end, via experiments on 4 datasets and under 2 fine-tuning settings, we find that as the MLLM is fine-tuned, it indeed gains domain-specific visual capabilities, but the updates do not lead to the projection extracting relevant domain-specific visual attributes. Our results indicate that the domain-specific visual attributes are modeled by the LLM, even when only the projection is fine-tuned.

Therefore, the optimization of these devices is essential in precision agriculture. Recently, with the advancements of deep learning, there have been several studies aiming to harness its capabilities for improving spray system performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the size of the training dataset, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. To address the challenge of insufficient training samples, this paper proposes an alternative solution by generating artificial images of droplets using generative adversarial networks (GAN). The GAN model is trained by using a small dataset captured by a high-speed camera and capable of generating images with progressively increasing resolution. The results demonstrate that the model can generate high-quality images with the size of $1024\times1024$. Furthermore, this research leverages recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning to develop a light droplet detector using the synthetic dataset. As a result, the detection model achieves a 16.06\% increase in mean average precision (mAP) when utilizing the synthetic dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work stands as the first to employ a generative model for augmenting droplet detection. Its significance lies not only in optimizing nozzle design for constructing efficient spray systems but also in addressing the common challenge of insufficient data in various precision agriculture tasks.

Text documents must be prepared and represented in a way that is appropriate for the algorithms used for data mining prior to classification. As a result, a number of term weighting strategies have been created in the literature to enhance text categorization algorithms' functionality. This study compares the effects of Binary and Term frequency weighting feature methodologies on the text's classification method when stop words are eliminated once and when they are not. In recognition of assessing the effects of prior weighting of features approaches on classification results in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure values, we used an Arabic data set made up of 322 documents divided into six main topics (agriculture, economy, health, politics, science, and sport), each of which contains 50 documents, with the exception of the health category, which contains 61 documents. The results demonstrate that for all metrics, the term frequency feature weighting approach with stop word removal outperforms the binary approach, while for accuracy, recall, and F-Measure, the binary approach outperforms the TF approach without stop word removal. However, for precision, the two approaches produce results that are very similar. Additionally, it is clear from the data that, using the same phrase weighting approach, stop word removing increases classification accuracy.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 11:31:04 UTC (493 KB)"

Comparatively, our understanding of how frontiers emerge in territories considered marginal in terms of agricultural productivity and global market integration remains weak. We synthesize conceptual tools explaining resource and land-use frontiers, including theories of land rent and agglomeration economies, of frontiers as successive waves, spaces of territorialization, friction, and opportunities, anticipation and expectation.

Processes of abnormal rent creation and capture and the built-up of agglomeration economies then constitute key mechanisms sustaining active frontiers.

Challenges such as these are often addressed using dynamical systems models (DSM) or agent-based models (ABM). Both modeling approaches have strengths and weaknesses. DSM are praised for their analytical tractability and efficient exploration of asymptotic dynamics and bifurcation, which are enabled by reduced number and heterogeneity of system components. ABM allows representing heterogeneity, agency, learning and interactions of diverse agents within SES, but this also comes at a price such as inefficiency to explore asymptotic dynamics or bifurcations. In this paper we combine DSM and ABM to leverage strengths of each modeling technique and gain deeper insights into dynamics of a system. We start with an ABM and research questions that the ABM was not able to answer. Using results of the ABM analysis as inputs for DSM, we create a DSM. Stability and bifurcation analysis of the DSM gives partial answers to the research questions and direct attention to where additional details are needed. This informs further ABM analysis, prevents burdening the ABM with less important details and reveals new insights about system dynamics. The iterative process and dialogue between the ABM and DSM leads to more complete answers to research questions and surpasses insights provided by each of the models separately.

However, concerns about the impact of pesticides on biodiversity, ecosystems, and human health, especially for populations residing close to cultivated areas, are growing. This study investigates how exposure and possible risks to residents can be estimated at high spatial granularity based on plant protection product data. The complexities of such analysis were explored in France, where relevant data with good granularity are publicly available. Integrating sets of spatial datasets and exposure assessment methodologies, we have developed an indicator to monitor the levels of pesticide risk faced by residents. By spatialising pesticide sales data according to their authorization on specific crops, we developed a detailed map depicting potential pesticide loads at parcel level across France. This spatial distribution served as the basis for an exposure and risk assessment, modelled following the European Food Safety Authority's guidelines. Combining the risk map with population distribution data, we have developed an indicator that allows to monitor patterns in non-dietary exposure to pesticides. Our results show that in France, on average, 13% of people might be exposed to pesticides due to living in the proximity to treated crops. This exposure is in the lower range for 34%, moderate range for 40% and higher range for 25% of the exposed population. The risk evaluation is based on worst case assumptions and values should not be taken as a regulatory risk assessment but as indicator to use, for example, for monitoring time trends. The purpose of this indicator is to demonstrate that more granular pesticide data can improve risk reduction strategies.

Mollusc farming can be affected by HABs because, as filter feeders, they can accumulate high concentrations of marine biotoxins in their tissues. To avoid the risk to human consumption, harvesting is prohibited when toxicity is detected. At present, the closure of production areas is based on expert knowledge and the existence of a predictive model would help when conditions are complex and sampling is not possible. Although the concentration of toxin in meat is the method most commonly used by experts in the control of shellfish production areas, it is rarely used as a target by automatic prediction models. This is largely due to the irregularity of the data due to the established sampling programs. As an alternative, the activity status of production areas has been proposed as a target variable based on whether mollusc meat has a toxicity level below or above the legal limit. This new option is the most similar to the actual functioning of the control of shellfish production areas. For this purpose, we have made a comparison between hybrid machine learning models like Neural-Network-Adding Bootstrap (BAGNET) and Discriminative Nearest Neighbor Classification (SVM-KNN) when estimating the state of production areas. The study has been carried out in several estuaries with different levels of complexity in the episodes of algal blooms to demonstrate the generalization capacity of the models in bloom detection. As a result, we could observe that, with an average recall value of 93.41% and without dropping below 90% in any of the estuaries, BAGNET outperforms the other models both in terms of results and robustness.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 15:59:22 UTC (472 KB)"

The main risk to mussel farming is harmful algal blooms (HABs), which pose a risk to human consumption. In Galicia, the Spanish main producer of cultivated mussels, the opening and closing of the production areas is controlled by a monitoring program. In addition to the closures resulting from the presence of toxicity exceeding the legal threshold, in the absence of a confirmatory sampling and the existence of risk factors, precautionary closures may be applied. These decisions are made by experts without the support or formalisation of the experience on which they are based. Therefore, this work proposes a predictive model capable of supporting the application of precautionary closures. Achieving sensitivity, accuracy and kappa index values of 97.34%, 91.83% and 0.75 respectively, the kNN algorithm has provided the best results. This allows the creation of a system capable of helping in complex situations where forecast errors are more common.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 15:51:58 UTC (24,412 KB)"

Facing climate change and limited agricultural knowledge, we use Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with a crop simulator to model AI agents' interactions with farming environments. We apply deep Q-learning with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based Q networks for training agents on optimal actions. Also, we develop Machine Learning (ML) models to predict N$_2$O emissions, integrating these predictions into the simulator. Our research tackles uncertainties in N$_2$O emission estimates with a probabilistic ML approach and climate variability through a stochastic weather model, offering a range of emission outcomes to improve forecast reliability and decision-making. By incorporating climate change effects, we enhance agents' climate adaptability, aiming for resilient agricultural practices. Results show these agents can align crop productivity with environmental concerns by penalizing N$_2$O emissions, adapting effectively to climate shifts like warmer temperatures and less rain. This strategy improves farm management under climate change, highlighting AI's role in sustainable agriculture.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 22:29:40 UTC (244 KB)"

In addressing this problem, many aspects, including the welfare of farmers, the economy, and the environment, must be considered. Under this backdrop, our work focuses on several resource-matching problems accounting for agents with multi-crop portfolios, geographic constraints, and fairness. First, we address a matching problem where the goal is to maximize a welfare function in two-sided markets where buyers' requirements and sellers' supplies are represented by value functions that assign prices (or costs) to specified volumes of water. For the setting where the value functions satisfy certain monotonicity properties, we present an efficient algorithm that maximizes a social welfare function. When there are minimum water requirement constraints, we present a randomized algorithm which ensures that the constraints are satisfied in expectation. For a single seller--multiple buyers setting with fairness constraints, we design an efficient algorithm that maximizes the minimum level of satisfaction of any buyer. We also present computational complexity results that highlight the limits on the generalizability of our results. We evaluate the algorithms developed in our work with experiments on both real-world and synthetic data sets with respect to drought severity, value functions, and seniority of agents.","Fri, 9 Feb 2024 17:50:40 UTC (4,584 KB)[v2] Mon, 12 Feb 2024 02:17:04 UTC (4,657 KB)"

Vermaire, Lisa Tran","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","Most paints contain pigments that absorb light and fade over time. A robust alternative can be found in nature, where structural coloration arises from the interference of light with submicron features. Plant-derived, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mimic these features by self-assembling into a cholesteric liquid crystal that exhibits structural coloration when dried. While much research has been done on CNCs in aqueous solutions, less is known about transferring CNCs to apolar solvents that are widely employed in paints. This study uses a common surfactant in agricultural and industrial products to suspend CNCs in toluene that are then dried into structurally colored films. Surprisingly, a stable liquid crystal phase is formed within hours, even with concentrations of up to 50 wt.-%. Evaporating the apolar CNC suspensions results in photonic films with peak wavelengths ranging from 660 to 920 nm. The resulting flexible films show increased mechanical strength, enabling a blue-shift into the visible spectrum with applied force. The films also act as humidity sensors, with increasing relative humidity yielding a red-shift. With the addition of a single surfactant, CNCs can be made compatible with existing production methods of industrial coatings, while improving the strength and responsiveness of structurally-colored films to external stimuli.","Fri, 9 Feb 2024 15:22:00 UTC (19,809 KB)"

Conventional AMR automation approaches are modularized into perception, motion planning and control which is computationally inefficient, and requires explicit feature extraction and engineering, that inhibits generalization, and deployment at scale. Few works have focused on real-world end-to-end approaches that directly map sensor inputs to control outputs due to the large amount of well curated training data required for supervised Deep Learning (DL) which is time consuming and labor intensive to collect and label, and sample inefficiency and challenges to bridging the simulation to reality gap using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This paper presents a novel method to efficiently train DRL for robust end-to-end AMR exploration, in a constrained environment at physical limits in simulation, transferred zero-shot to the real-world. The representation learned in a compact parameter space with 2 fully connected layers with 64 nodes each is demonstrated to exhibit emergent behavior for out-of-distribution generalization to navigation in new environments that include unstructured terrain without maps, and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The learned policy outperforms conventional navigation algorithms while consuming a fraction of the computation resources, enabling execution on a range of AMR forms with varying embedded computer payloads.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 18:17:54 UTC (37,746 KB)"

In the rapidly advancing field of agricultural robotics, the necessity of training robots in a virtual environment has become essential. Generating training data to automatize the underlying computer vision tasks such as image segmentation, object detection and classification, also heavily relies on such virtual environments as synthetic data is often required to overcome the shortage and lack of variety of real data sets. However, physics engines commonly employed within the robotics community, such as ODE, Simbody, Bullet, and DART, primarily support motion and collision interaction of rigid bodies. This inherent limitation hinders experimentation and progress in handling non-rigid objects such as plants and crops. In this contribution, we present a plugin for the Gazebo simulation platform based on Cosserat rods to model plant motion. It enables the simulation of plants and their interaction with the environment. We demonstrate that, using our plugin, users can conduct harvesting simulations in Gazebo by simulating a robotic arm picking fruits and achieve results comparable to real-world experiments.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 17:19:46 UTC (10,621 KB)"

Studies have demonstrated that fusing SAR and optical images can significantly enhance the accuracy of classification. However, a major challenge in this field is the limited availability of training data, which adversely affects the performance of classifiers. In agricultural regions, the dominant crops typically consist of one or two specific types, while other crops are scarce. Consequently, when collecting training samples to create a map of agricultural products, there is an abundance of samples from the dominant crops, forming the majority classes. Conversely, samples from other crops are scarce, representing the minority classes. Addressing this issue requires overcoming several challenges and weaknesses associated with traditional data generation methods. These methods have been employed to tackle the imbalanced nature of the training data. Nevertheless, they still face limitations in effectively handling the minority classes. Overall, the issue of inadequate training data, particularly for minority classes, remains a hurdle that traditional methods struggle to overcome. In this research, We explore the effectiveness of conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) as a synthetic data generation method based on a deep learning network, in addressing the challenge of limited training data for minority classes in crop classification using the fusion of SAR-optical data. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method generates synthetic data with higher quality that can significantly increase the number of samples for minority classes leading to better performance of crop classifiers.","Sat, 3 Feb 2024 11:07:50 UTC (7,664 KB)"

This motivated a study of the trends in HW events over Extremadura, a region in the southwest of Spain, with much of its area in summer devoted to the production of irrigated crops such as maize and tomatoes. Heat waves were defined for the study as two consecutive days with temperatures above the 95th percentile of the summer (June-August) maximum temperature (Tmax) time series. Two datasets were used: one consisted of 13 daily temperature records uniformly distributed over the Region, and the other was the SPAIN02 gridded observational dataset, extracting just the points corresponding to Extremadura. The trends studied were in the duration, intensity, and frequency of HW events, and in other parameters such as the mean, low (25th percentile), and high (75th percentile) values. In general terms, the results showed significant positive trends in those parameters over the east, the northwest, and a small area in the south of the Region. In order to study changes in HW characteristics (duration, frequency and intensity) considering different subperiods, a stochastic model was used to generate 1000 time series equivalent to the observed ones. The results showed that there were no significant changes in HW duration in the last 10-year subperiod in comparison with the first.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have revolutionized weather forecasting by achieving competitive predictive skills to numerical models. However, training such foundation models requires thousands of GPU days, which causes substantial carbon emissions and limits their broader applicability. Moreover, ML models tend to fool the pixel-wise error scores by producing smoothed results which lack physical consistency and meteorological meaning. To deal with the aforementioned problems, we propose a teleconnection-informed transformer. Our architecture leverages the pretrained Pangu model to achieve good initial weights and integrates a teleconnection-informed temporal module to improve predictability in an extended temporal range. Remarkably, by adjusting 1.1% of the Pangu model's parameters, our method enhances predictability on four surface and five upper-level atmospheric variables at a two-week lead time. Furthermore, the teleconnection-filtered features improve the spatial granularity of outputs significantly, indicating their potential physical consistency. Our research underscores the importance of atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections in driving future weather conditions. Besides, it presents a resource-efficient pathway for researchers to leverage existing foundation models on versatile downstream tasks.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 14:27:35 UTC (2,123 KB)[v2] Mon, 5 Feb 2024 12:43:24 UTC (2,123 KB)"

Efforts to boost African farmers' agricultural production through fertilizer use can inadvertently promote the growth of aquatic vegetation that hosts disease vectors. Recent trials established that removing aquatic vegetation habitat for snail intermediate hosts reduces schistosomiasis infection rates in children, while converting the harvested vegetation into compost boosts agricultural productivity and incomes. Our model illustrates how this ecological intervention changes the feedback between the human and natural systems, potentially freeing rural households from poverty-disease traps. We develop a bioeconomic model that interacts an analytical microeconomic model of agricultural households' behavior, health status and incomes over time with a dynamic model of schistosomiasis disease ecology. We calibrate the model with field data from northern Senegal. We show analytically and via simulation that local conversion of invasive aquatic vegetation to compost changes the feedbacks among interlinked disease, aquatic and agricultural systems, reducing schistosomiasis infection and increasing incomes relative to the current status quo, in which villagers rarely remove vegetation. Aquatic vegetation removal disrupts the poverty-disease trap by reducing habitat for snails that vector the infectious helminth and by promoting production of compost that returns to agricultural soils nutrients that currently leach into surface water from on-farm fertilizer applications. The result is healthier people, more productive labor, cleaner water, more productive agriculture, and higher incomes.","Tue, 30 Jan 2024 19:10:31 UTC (977 KB)"

A further objective was to find out the influence of image type, land cover or parcel size on the area measurement variability. In our experiment, five independent operators measured 185 parcels, 3 times, on each image. Next, the buffer width, calculated as the difference between measured and reference parcel area, was derived and was the subject of statistical analysis. Prior to verifying the normality of the buffer widths, a detection of anomalous measurements is recommended. This detection of outliers within each group of observations (i.e. parcels) was made using the Jacknife distance test on each type of imagery (Cartosat Aft, Cartosat Fore). Then, the General Linear Model procedure to identify major significant effects and interactions was followed by analysis of variance to ease the interpretation of the variability observed of the area measurement. Finally, two different parameters, reproducibility limit and critical difference, were calculated to make comparison with other sensors like digital aerial orthophoto in this study possible.

In the agricultural sector, one of the most important CS applications is to provide timely and accurate yield forecasts based on climate prediction. In this study, the Pasture Simulation model (PaSim) was used to simulate, for the period 1959-2015, the forage production of a mown grassland system (Laqueuille, Massif Central of France) under different management conditions, with meteorological inputs extracted from the SAFRAN atmospheric database. The aim was to generate purely climate-dependent timeseries of optimal forage production, a variable that was maximized by brighter and warmer weather conditions at the grassland. A long-term increase was observed in simulated forage yield, with the 1995-2015 average being 29% higher than the 1959-1979 average. Such increase seems consistent with observed rising trends in temperature and CO2, and multi-decadal changes in incident solar radiation. At interannual timescales, sea surface temperature anomalies of the Mediterranean (MED), Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), equatorial Pacific (El Niño Southern Oscillation) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index were found robustly correlated with annual forage yield values. Relying only on climatic predictors, we developed a stepwise statistical multi-regression model with leave-one-out cross-validation. Under specific management conditions (e.g., three annual cuts) and from one to five months in advance, the generated model successfully provided a p-value<0.01 in correlation (t-test), a root mean square error percentage (%RMSE) of 14.6% and a 71.43% hit rate predicting above/below average years in terms of forage yield collection.","Thu, 25 Jan 2024 10:17:49 UTC (10,031 KB)"

We present results from field trials that compare robotic spot spraying against industry-standard broadcast spraying, by measuring the weed control efficacy, the reduction in herbicide usage, and the water quality improvements in irrigation runoff. The average results across 25 hectares of field trials show that spot spraying on sugarcane farms is 97% as effective as broadcast spraying and reduces herbicide usage by 35%, proportionally to the weed density. For specific trial strips with lower weed pressure, spot spraying reduced herbicide usage by up to 65%. Water quality measurements of irrigation-induced runoff, three to six days after spraying, showed reductions in the mean concentration and mean load of herbicides of 39% and 54%, respectively, compared to broadcast spraying. These promising results reveal the capability of spot spraying technology to reduce herbicide usage on sugarcane farms without impacting weed control and potentially providing sustained water quality benefits.","Thu, 25 Jan 2024 04:04:44 UTC (27,106 KB)"

At the same time, the sheer amount of data poses a great challenge to data storage and analysis, and the \textit{de facto} data management and analysis practices adopted by scientists have become increasingly inefficient. Additionally, the data generated from different disciplines, such as genomics, phenomics, environment, agronomy, and socioeconomic, can be highly heterogeneous. That is, datasets across disciplines often do not share the same ontology, modality, or format. All of the above make it necessary to design a new data management infrastructure that implements the principles of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). In this paper, we propose Agriculture Data Management and Analytics (ADMA), which satisfies the FAIR principles. Our new data management infrastructure is intelligent by supporting semantic data management across disciplines, interactive by providing various data management/analysis portals such as web GUI, command line, and API, scalable by utilizing the power of high-performance computing (HPC), extensible by allowing users to load their own data analysis tools, trackable by keeping track of different operations on each file, and open by using a rich set of mature open source technologies.","Tue, 7 Nov 2023 22:02:54 UTC (37,198 KB)"

In this paper, we design and implement a holistic LoRa-based IoT system with LoRa communication capabilities, named SPARC-LoRa, which consists of field sensor nodes and a gateway connected to the Internet. SPARC-LoRa has the following important features. First, the proposed wireless network of SPARC-LoRa is even-driven and using off-the-shelf microcontroller and LoRa communication modules with a customized PCB design to integrate all the hardware. This enables SPARC-LoRa to achieve low power consumption, long range communication, and low cost. With a new connection-based upper layer protocol design, the scalability and communication reliability of SPARC-loRa can be achieved. Second, an open source software including sensor nodes and servers is designed based on Docker container with cloud storage, computing, and LTE functionalities. In order to achieve reliable wireless communication under extreme conditions, a relay module is designed and applied to SPARC-LoRa to forward the data from sensor nodes to the gateway node. The system design and implementation is completely open source and hosted on the DigitalOcean Droplet Cloud. Hence, the proposed system enables further research and applications in both academia and industry. The proposed system has been tested in real fields under different and extreme environmental conditions in Salt Lake City, Utah and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The experimental results validate the features of SPARC-LoRa including low power, reliability, and cloud services provided by SPARC-LoRa.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 16:30:21 UTC (2,625 KB)"

Due to increased transportation and trade, non-native species have been introduced to new environments, causing damage to ecosystems and leading to economic losses in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Therefore, there is a pressing need for risk assessment and management techniques to mitigate the impact of these invasions. This study aims to develop a new physics-inspired model to forecast maritime shipping traffic and thus inform risk assessment of invasive species spread through global transportation networks. Inspired by the gravity model for international trades, our model considers various factors that influence the likelihood and impact of vessel activities, such as shipping flux density, distance between ports, trade flow, and centrality measures of transportation hubs. Additionally, by analyzing the risk network of invasive species, we provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the invasion threat level given a pair of origin and destination. Accordingly, this paper introduces transformers to gravity models to rebuild the short- and long-term dependencies that make the risk analysis feasible. Thus, we introduce a physics-inspired framework that achieves an 89% segmentation accuracy for existing and non-existing trajectories and an 84.8% accuracy for the number of vessels flowing between key port areas, representing more than 10% improvement over the traditional deep-gravity model. Along these lines, this research contributes to a better understanding of invasive species risk assessment. It allows policymakers, conservationists, and stakeholders to prioritize management actions by identifying high-risk invasion pathways. Besides, our model is versatile and can include new data sources, making it suitable for assessing species invasion risks in a changing global landscape.","Tue, 23 Jan 2024 21:22:51 UTC (5,696 KB)[v2] Mon, 29 Jan 2024 16:43:03 UTC (5,662 KB)"

However, this task is complex and depends on multiple factors, such as environmental conditions, soil properties, and management practices. Combining heterogeneous data views poses a fusion challenge, like identifying the view-specific contribution to the predictive task. We present a novel multi-view learning approach to predict crop yield for different crops (soybean, wheat, rapeseed) and regions (Argentina, Uruguay, and Germany). Our multi-view input data includes multi-spectral optical images from Sentinel-2 satellites and weather data as dynamic features during the crop growing season, complemented by static features like soil properties and topographic information. To effectively fuse the data, we introduce a Multi-view Gated Fusion (MVGF) model, comprising dedicated view-encoders and a Gated Unit (GU) module. The view-encoders handle the heterogeneity of data sources with varying temporal resolutions by learning a view-specific representation. These representations are adaptively fused via a weighted sum. The fusion weights are computed for each sample by the GU using a concatenation of the view-representations. The MVGF model is trained at sub-field level with 10 m resolution pixels. Our evaluations show that the MVGF outperforms conventional models on the same task, achieving the best results by incorporating all the data sources, unlike the usual fusion results in the literature. For Argentina, the MVGF model achieves an R2 value of 0.68 at sub-field yield prediction, while at field level evaluation (comparing field averages), it reaches around 0.80 across different countries. The GU module learned different weights based on the country and crop-type, aligning with the variable significance of each data source to the prediction task.","Mon, 22 Jan 2024 11:01:52 UTC (8,222 KB)"

This paper proposes a battery-free sensor array which can be used for wireless multi-depth in-situ sensing. Utilizing Near Field Communication (NFC)-which can penetrate soil with negligible signal power loss-this sensor array can form a virtual magnetic waveguide, achieving long communication ranges. An analytical model has been developed to offer insights and determine optimal design parameters.

This event occurs when the minimum ambient temperature falls below a certain value. This phenomenon causes a lot of damage to the country, especially Fars province. Solving this problem requires that, in addition to predicting the minimum temperature, we can provide enough time to implement the necessary measures. Empirical methods have been provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which can predict the minimum temperature, but not in time. In addition to this, we can use machine learning methods to model the minimum temperature. In this study, we have used three methods Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as deep learning methods, and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). A customized loss function designed for methods based on deep learning, which can be effective in reducing prediction errors. With methods based on deep learning models, not only do we observe a reduction in RMSE error compared to empirical methods but also have more time to predict minimum temperature. Thus, we can model the minimum temperature for the next 24 hours by having the current 24 hours. With the gradient boosting model (XGBoost) we can keep the prediction time as deep learning and RMSE error reduced. Finally, we experimentally concluded that machine learning methods work better than empirical methods and XGBoost model can have better performance in this problem among other implemented.","Sun, 21 Jan 2024 11:02:00 UTC (698 KB)"

The performance of this sector has an overwhelming impact on the primary macroeconomic objectives like food security, employment generation, poverty alleviation, human resources development, and other economic and social forces. Although Bangladesh's labor-intensive agriculture has achieved steady increases in food grain production, it often suffered from unfavorable weather conditions such as heavy rainfall, low temperature, and drought. Consequently, these factors hinder the production of food substantially, putting the country's overall food security in danger. In order to have a profitable, sustainable, and farmer-friendly agricultural practice, this paper proposes a context-based crop recommendation system powered by a weather forecast model. With extensive evaluation, the multivariate Stacked Bi-LSTM (three Bi-LSTM layers with a time Distributed layer) Network is employed as the weather forecasting model. The proposed weather model can forecast Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity, and Sunshine for any given location in Bangladesh with an average R-squared value of 0.9824, and the model outperforms other state-of-the-art LSTM models. These predictions guide our system in generating viable farming decisions. Additionally, our full-fledged system is capable of alerting the farmers about extreme weather conditions so that preventive measures can be undertaken to protect the crops. Finally, the system is also adept at making knowledge-based crop suggestions for the flood and drought-prone regions of Bangladesh.","Sun, 21 Jan 2024 06:33:45 UTC (7,480 KB)[v2] Wed, 13 Mar 2024 02:03:20 UTC (7,600 KB)"

The object detector, You Look Only Once (YOLO), has gained popularity in agriculture in a relatively short span due to its state-of-the-art performance. YOLO offers real-time detection with good accuracy and is implemented in various agricultural tasks, including monitoring, surveillance, sensing, automation, and robotics. The research and application of YOLO in agriculture are accelerating rapidly but are fragmented and multidisciplinary. Moreover, the performance characteristics (i.e., accuracy, speed, computation) of the object detector influence the rate of technology implementation and adoption in agriculture. Thus, the study aims to collect extensive literature to document and critically evaluate the advances and application of YOLO for agricultural object recognition. First, we conducted a bibliometric review of 257 articles to understand the scholarly landscape of YOLO in agricultural domain. Secondly, we conducted a systematic review of 30 articles to identify current knowledge, gaps, and modifications in YOLO for specific agricultural tasks. The study critically assesses and summarizes the information on YOLO's end-to-end learning approach, including data acquisition, processing, network modification, integration, and deployment. We also discussed task-specific YOLO algorithm modification and integration to meet the agricultural object or environment-specific challenges.

Often, several types of samples are collected from individuals to provide more complete information about an animal's infection history. Methods that jointly analyze multiple data streams to study disease emergence and drivers of infection via epidemiological process models remain underdeveloped. Joint-analysis methods can more thoroughly analyze all available data, more precisely quantifying epidemic processes, outbreak status, and risks. We contribute a paired data modeling approach that analyzes multiple samples from individuals. We use ""characterization maps"" to link paired data to epidemiological processes through a hierarchical statistical observation model. Our approach can provide both Bayesian and frequentist estimates of epidemiological parameters and state. We motivate our approach through the need to use paired pathogen and antibody detection tests to estimate parameters and infection trajectories for the widely applicable susceptible, infectious, recovered (SIR) model. We contribute general formulas to link characterization maps to arbitrary process models and datasets and an extended SIR model that better accommodates paired data. We find via simulation that paired data can more efficiently estimate SIR parameters than unpaired data, requiring samples from 5-10 times fewer individuals. We then study SARS-CoV-2 in wild White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from three counties in the United States. Estimates for average infectious times corroborate captive animal studies. Our methods use general statistical theory to let applications extend beyond the SIR model we consider, and to more complicated examples of paired data.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 15:24:56 UTC (1,404 KB)"

Food supply chain is the process of tracing a crop from the farmer or producer to the buyer. With the advent of blockchain, providing a safe and fraud-free environment for the provision of numerous agricultural necessities has become much easier. Because of the globalization of trade, the present supply chain market today includes various companies involving integration of data, complex transactions and distribution. Information tamper resistance, supply-demand relationships, and traceable oversight are all difficulties that arise as a result of this. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that can provide information that is resistant to tampering. This strategy can eliminate the need for a centralized trusted authority, intermediaries, and business histories, allowing for increased production and security while maintaining the highest levels of integrity, liability, and safety. In order to have an integrity and transparency in food supply chain in the agricultural sector, a framework is proposed here based on block chain and IoT.","Sun, 14 Jan 2024 04:16:01 UTC (292 KB)"

Different spectral capturing setups, e.g., based on filter-wheel, push-broom, line-scanning, or mosaic cameras, have been introduced in the last years to support a wide range of applications in agriculture, medicine, and industrial surveillance. However, these systems often suffer from different disadvantages, such as lack of real-time capability, limited spectral coverage or low spatial resolution. To address these drawbacks, we present a novel approach combining two calibrated multispectral real-time capable snapshot cameras, covering different spectral ranges, into a stereo-system. Therefore, a hyperspectral data-cube can be continuously captured. The combined use of different multispectral snapshot cameras enables both 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis.

While the term foundation model has quickly garnered interest from the geospatial domain, its definition remains vague. Hence, this paper will first introduce AI foundation models and their defining characteristics. Built upon the tremendous success achieved by Large Language Models (LLMs) as the foundation models for language tasks, this paper discusses the challenges of building foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) vision tasks. To evaluate the performance of large AI vision models, especially Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM), we implemented different instance segmentation pipelines that minimize the changes to SAM to leverage its power as a foundation model. A series of prompt strategies was developed to test SAM's performance regarding its theoretical upper bound of predictive accuracy, zero-shot performance, and domain adaptability through fine-tuning. The analysis used two permafrost feature datasets, ice-wedge polygons and retrogressive thaw slumps because (1) these landform features are more challenging to segment than manmade features due to their complicated formation mechanisms, diverse forms, and vague boundaries; (2) their presence and changes are important indicators for Arctic warming and climate change. The results show that although promising, SAM still has room for improvement to support AI-augmented terrain mapping. The spatial and domain generalizability of this finding is further validated using a more general dataset EuroCrop for agricultural field mapping. Finally, we discuss future research directions that strengthen SAM's applicability in challenging geospatial domains.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 19:10:09 UTC (6,069 KB)"

Monitoring plants and measuring their traits is an important task in agriculture often referred to as plant phenotyping. Traditionally, this task is done manually, which is time- and labor-intensive. Robots can automate phenotyping providing reproducible and high-frequency measurements. Today's perception systems use deep learning to interpret these measurements, but require a substantial amount of annotated data to work well. Obtaining such labels is challenging as it often requires background knowledge on the side of the labelers. This paper addresses the problem of reducing the labeling effort required to perform leaf instance segmentation on 3D point clouds, which is a first step toward phenotyping in 3D. Separating all leaves allows us to count them and compute relevant traits as their areas, lengths, and widths. We propose a novel self-supervised task-specific pre-training approach to initialize the backbone of a network for leaf instance segmentation. We also introduce a novel automatic postprocessing that considers the difficulty of correctly segmenting the points close to the stem, where all the leaves petiole overlap. The experiments presented in this paper suggest that our approach boosts the performance over all the investigated scenarios. We also evaluate the embeddings to assess the quality of the fully unsupervised approach and see a higher performance of our domain-specific postprocessing.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 08:11:08 UTC (1,419 KB)"

The mechanisms underlying the transition from meteorological to agricultural drought and its features were investigated. Various non-parametric standardized drought indices were utilized. For meteorological droughts, the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was employed, while the Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI), Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI), and Standard Precipitation, Evapotranspiration and Soil Moisture Index (SPESMI) were utilized for agricultural droughts, while their ability to identify relative vegetation stress in areas affected by severe droughts was investigated using the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) Anomaly provided by the Copernicus European Drought Observatory (EDO). A statistical approach based on run theory was employed to analyze several characteristics of drought propagation, such as response time scale, propagation probability, and lag time at monthly, seasonal, and six-month time scales. The retrieved response time scale was fast, about 1-2 months, and the probability of occurrence increased with the severity of the originating meteorological drought. The duration of agricultural drought was shorter than that of meteorological drought, with a delayed onset but the same term. The results obtained by multi-variate indices showed a more rapid propagation process and a tendency to identify more severe events than uni-variate indices. In general terms, agricultural indices were found to be effective in assessing vegetation stress in the Iberian Peninsula. A newly developed combined agricultural drought index was found to balance the characteristics of the other adopted indices and may be useful for future studies.","Sun, 14 Jan 2024 10:34:56 UTC (2,259 KB)"

Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer? Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p. when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further. In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%. Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 14:44:47 UTC (1,300 KB)[v2] Wed, 17 Jan 2024 20:03:15 UTC (1,300 KB)[v3] Tue, 30 Jan 2024 13:55:34 UTC (1,300 KB)"

While several studies have addressed this challenging task from a sequence-to-sequence perspective, most of them have focused on a single area without considering the existing correlation between multiple disjoint regions. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal graph sequence nowcasting problem. In particular, we introduce Graph Dual-stream Convolutional Attention Fusion (GD-CAF), a novel approach designed to learn from historical spatiotemporal graph of precipitation maps and nowcast future time step ahead precipitation at different spatial locations. GD-CAF consists of spatio-temporal convolutional attention as well as gated fusion modules which are equipped with depthwise-separable convolutional operations. This enhancement enables the model to directly process the high-dimensional spatiotemporal graph of precipitation maps and exploits higher-order correlations between the data dimensions. We evaluate our model on seven years of precipitation maps across Europe and its neighboring areas collected from the ERA5 dataset, provided by Copernicus Climate Change Services. The experimental results reveal the superior performance of the GD-CAF model compared to the other examined models. Additionally, visualizations of averaged seasonal spatial and temporal attention scores across the test set offer valuable insights into the most robust connections between diverse regions or time steps.","Mon, 15 Jan 2024 20:54:20 UTC (7,451 KB)[v2] Mon, 26 Feb 2024 16:21:55 UTC (7,452 KB)"

Yet the way a system is designed and marketed often has wider repercussions, such as rebound effects, and systemic change in practices. These effects are harder to assess (and to anticipate) than the direct physical impact of the construction and use of the system itself. Current tools are unable to account for the complexity of these effects: the underlying causal mechanisms, their multi-level nature, their different temporalities, and the variety of their consequences (environmental and societal). This is why we are seeking to develop a specific methodology and tool, inspired by systemic design and system dynamics. These are intended for decision-makers and designers of interactive systems within systems of systems (for example, in the fields of agricultural robotics or public transportation).

One of the major challenges faced by these approaches is the limited availability of ground truth labels. In the absence of ground truth, existing work usually adopts the ""direct transfer strategy"" that trains a classifier using historical labels collected from other regions and then applies the trained model to the target region. Unfortunately, the spectral features of crops exhibit inter-region and inter-annual variability due to changes in soil composition, climate conditions, and crop progress, the resultant models perform poorly on new and unseen regions or years. This paper presents the Crop Generative Adversarial Network (CropGAN) to address the above cross-domain issue. Our approach does not need labels from the target domain. Instead, it learns a mapping function to transform the spectral features of the target domain to the source domain (with labels) while preserving their local structure. The classifier trained by the source domain data can be directly applied to the transformed data to produce high-accuracy early crop maps of the target domain. Comprehensive experiments across various regions and years demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with the widely adopted direct transfer strategy, the F1 score after applying the proposed CropGAN is improved by 13.13% - 50.98%","Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:27:41 UTC (9,424 KB)"

However, in the context of Africa, practical applications are often hindered by the limited availability of high-resolution cropland maps. Such maps typically require extensive human labeling, thereby creating a scalability bottleneck. To address this, we propose an approach that utilizes unsupervised object clustering to refine existing weak labels, such as those obtained from global cropland maps. The refined labels, in conjunction with sparse human annotations, serve as training data for a semantic segmentation network designed to identify cropland areas. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the benefits of the improved weak labels generated by our method. In a scenario where we train our model with only 33 human-annotated labels, the F_1 score for the cropland category increases from 0.53 to 0.84 when we add the mined negative labels.","Sat, 13 Jan 2024 08:45:41 UTC (33,894 KB)"

Aiming at the problems of serious spectral confusion in visible high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images of different phases, interference of large complex background and salt-and-pepper noise by existing semantic change detection (SCD) algorithms, in order to effectively extract deep image features of crops and meet the demand of agricultural practical engineering applications, this paper designs and proposes an agricultural geographic scene and parcel-scale constrained SCD framework for crops (AGSPNet). AGSPNet framework contains three parts: agricultural geographic scene (AGS) division module, parcel edge extraction module and crop SCD module. Meanwhile, we produce and introduce an UAV image SCD dataset (CSCD) dedicated to agricultural monitoring, encompassing multiple semantic variation types of crops in complex geographical scene. We conduct comparative experiments and accuracy evaluations in two test areas of this dataset, and the results show that the crop SCD results of AGSPNet consistently outperform other deep learning SCD models in terms of quantity and quality, with the evaluation metrics F1-score, kappa, OA, and mIoU obtaining improvements of 0.038, 0.021, 0.011 and 0.062, respectively, on average over the sub-optimal method.

Narahari","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Mechanism design is essentially reverse engineering of games and involves inducing a game among strategic agents in a way that the induced game satisfies a set of desired properties in an equilibrium of the game. Desirable properties for a mechanism include incentive compatibility, individual rationality, welfare maximisation, revenue maximisation (or cost minimisation), fairness of allocation, etc. It is known from mechanism design theory that only certain strict subsets of these properties can be simultaneously satisfied exactly by any given mechanism. Often, the mechanisms required by real-world applications may need a subset of these properties that are theoretically impossible to be simultaneously satisfied. In such cases, a prominent recent approach is to use a deep learning based approach to learn a mechanism that approximately satisfies the required properties by minimizing a suitably defined loss function. In this paper, we present, from relevant literature, technical details of using a deep learning approach for mechanism design and provide an overview of key results in this topic. We demonstrate the power of this approach for three illustrative case studies: (a) efficient energy management in a vehicular network (b) resource allocation in a mobile network (c) designing a volume discount procurement auction for agricultural inputs.

We propose an end-to-end trainable learning network (DedustNet) to solve the real-world agricultural dust removal task. To our knowledge, DedustNet is the first time Swin Transformer-based units have been used in wavelet networks for agricultural image dusting. Specifically, we present the frequency-dominated block (DWTFormer block and IDWTFormer block) by adding a spatial features aggregation scheme (SFAS) to the Swin Transformer and combining it with the wavelet transform, the DWTFormer block and IDWTFormer block, alleviating the limitation of the global receptive field of Swin Transformer when dealing with complex dusty backgrounds. Furthermore, We propose a cross-level information fusion module to fuse different levels of features and effectively capture global and long-range feature relationships. In addition, we present a dilated convolution module to capture contextual information guided by wavelet transform at multiple scales, which combines the advantages of wavelet transform and dilated convolution. Our algorithm leverages deep learning techniques to effectively remove dust from images while preserving the original structural and textural features. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, DedustNet achieves superior performance and more reliable results in agricultural image dedusting, providing strong support for the application of agricultural machinery in dusty environments. Additionally, the impressive performance on real-world hazy datasets and application tests highlights DedustNet superior generalization ability and computer vision-related application performance.","Tue, 9 Jan 2024 13:40:01 UTC (2,535 KB)"

However, several formulations of this class make either rather restrictive modelling assumptions or involve intricate algorithms for posterior inference, thus preventing their widespread use. In response to these challenges, we present a flexible, versatile, and computationally tractable model for density regression based on a single-weights dependent Dirichlet process mixture of normal distributions model for univariate continuous responses. We assume an additive structure for the mean of each mixture component and incorporate the effects of continuous covariates through smooth nonlinear functions. The key components of our modelling approach are penalised B-splines and their bivariate tensor product extension. Our proposed method also seamlessly accommodates parametric effects of categorical covariates, linear effects of continuous covariates, interactions between categorical and/or continuous covariates, varying coefficient terms, and random effects, which is why we refer our model as a Dirichlet process mixture of normal structured additive regression models. A noteworthy feature of our method is its efficiency in posterior simulation through Gibbs sampling, as closed-form full conditional distributions for all model parameters are available. Results from a simulation study demonstrate that our approach successfully recovers true conditional densities and other regression functionals in various challenging scenarios. Applications to a toxicology, disease diagnosis, and agricultural study are provided and further underpin the broad applicability of our modelling framework.

We jointly learn satellite scene geometry, illumination components, and sun direction in this single-model approach, and propose a secondary shadow ray casting technique to 1) improve scene geometry using oblique sun angles to render shadows, 2) enable physically-based disentanglement of scene albedo and illumination, and 3) determine the components of illumination from direct, ambient (sky), and complex sources. To achieve this, we incorporate lighting cues and geometric priors from remote sensing literature in a neural rendering approach, modeling physical properties of satellite scenes such as shadows, scattered sky illumination, and complex illumination and shading of vegetation and water. We evaluate the performance of SUNDIAL against existing NeRF-based techniques for satellite scene modeling and demonstrate improved scene and lighting disentanglement, novel view and lighting rendering, and geometry and sun direction estimation on challenging scenes with small baselines, sparse inputs, and variable illumination.","Sun, 24 Dec 2023 02:46:44 UTC (22,605 KB)"

However, such annotated datasets are also needed for natural, unstructured environments to enable semantic perception for applications, including conservation, search and rescue, environment monitoring, and agricultural automation. Therefore, we introduce WildScenes, a bi-modal benchmark dataset consisting of multiple large-scale traversals in natural environments, including semantic annotations in high-resolution 2D images and dense 3D lidar point clouds, and accurate 6-DoF pose information. The data is (1) trajectory-centric with accurate localization and globally aligned point clouds, (2) calibrated and synchronized to support bi-modal inference, and (3) containing different natural environments over 6 months to support research on domain adaptation. Our 3D semantic labels are obtained via an efficient automated process that transfers the human-annotated 2D labels from multiple views into 3D point clouds, thus circumventing the need for expensive and time-consuming human annotation in 3D. We introduce benchmarks on 2D and 3D semantic segmentation and evaluate a variety of recent deep-learning techniques to demonstrate the challenges in semantic segmentation in natural environments. We propose train-val-test splits for standard benchmarks as well as domain adaptation benchmarks and utilize an automated split generation technique to ensure the balance of class label distributions.

Advancements in field management through non-chemical weeding by robots in combination with monitoring of crops by autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and breeding of novel and more resilient crop varieties are helpful to address these challenges. The analysis of plant traits, called phenotyping, is an essential activity in plant breeding, it however involves a great amount of manual labor. With this paper, we address the problem of automatic fine-grained organ-level geometric analysis needed for precision phenotyping. As the availability of real-world data in this domain is relatively scarce, we propose a novel dataset that was acquired using UAVs capturing high-resolution images of a real breeding trial containing 48 plant varieties and therefore covering great morphological and appearance diversity. This enables the development of approaches for autonomous phenotyping that generalize well to different varieties. Based on overlapping high-resolution images from multiple viewing angles, we compute photogrammetric dense point clouds and provide detailed and accurate point-wise labels for plants, leaves, and salient points as the tip and the base. Additionally, we include measurements of phenotypic traits performed by experts from the German Federal Plant Variety Office on the real plants, allowing the evaluation of new approaches not only on segmentation and keypoint detection but also directly on the downstream tasks. The provided labeled point clouds enable fine-grained plant analysis and support further progress in the development of automatic phenotyping approaches, but also enable further research in surface reconstruction, point cloud completion, and semantic interpretation of point clouds.","Fri, 22 Dec 2023 14:06:44 UTC (40,211 KB)"

Though several plants have been identified and used as a potential candidate for such phytoremediation, the technique is still at its formative stage and has been mostly confined to laboratory and greenhouses. However, recently several field studies have shown promising results that can propel large-scale implementation of this technology in industrial sites and urban agriculture. Realistically, the commercialization of this technique is possible if interdisciplinary approach is employed to increase its efficiency.

To this end, many international organizations have funded training and technology transfer programs that aim to promote productivity and income growth, fight poverty and enhance food security among smallholder farmers in developing countries. Stochastic production frontier analysis can be a useful tool when evaluating the effectiveness of these programs. However, accounting for treatment endogeneity, often intrinsic to these interventions, only recently has received any attention in the stochastic frontier literature. In this work, we extend the classical maximum likelihood estimation of stochastic production frontier models by allowing both the production frontier and inefficiency to depend on a potentially endogenous binary treatment. We use instrumental variables to define an assignment mechanism for the treatment, and we explicitly model the density of the first and second-stage composite error terms. We provide empirical evidence of the importance of controlling for endogeneity in this setting using farm-level data from a soil conservation program in El Salvador.","Thu, 21 Dec 2023 15:32:31 UTC (6,150 KB)"

However, existing models struggle with complex relationships and characteristics of spectral-spatial data due to the multi-band nature and data redundancy of hyperspectral data. To address this limitation, we propose a new network called DiffSpectralNet, which combines diffusion and transformer techniques. Our approach involves a two-step process. First, we use an unsupervised learning framework based on the diffusion model to extract both high-level and low-level spectral-spatial features. The diffusion method is capable of extracting diverse and meaningful spectral-spatial features, leading to improvement in HSI classification. Then, we employ a pretrained denoising U-Net to extract intermediate hierarchical features for classification. Finally, we use a supervised transformer-based classifier to perform the HSI classification. Through comprehensive experiments on HSI datasets, we evaluate the classification performance of DiffSpectralNet. The results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.","Sun, 29 Oct 2023 15:26:37 UTC (6,322 KB)"

To guarantee UAV networking security, UAV identity authentication attracts wide attention, especially in the field environment without perfect infrastructure. Some blockchain-based UAV identity authentication solutions are proposed to establish decentralized and trusted authentication systems without relying on infrastructure. However, these solutions do not support disconnected UAV reconnection or even disband a cluster directly after its head UAV disconnection, which compromises cluster robustness and task result integrity. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based identity authentication solution oriented to multi-cluster UAV networking with a UAV disconnection mechanism and a task result backup mechanism. Specifically, we build a blockchain maintained by head UAVs of all clusters, managing identity information to guarantee the security of decentralized identity management. The UAV disconnection mechanism permits a verified distributed UAV reconnection to ensure the robustness of the UAV cluster, and on this basis, the task result backup mechanism ensures the integrity of the task results stored in a cluster even any UAV disconnection. Finally, extensive experimental results prove the superiority of our solutions in terms of robustness, integrity, delay, and energy consumption.","Wed, 15 Nov 2023 02:17:59 UTC (3,615 KB)"

The issue becomes extremely challenging in dynamic field environments. Yet, this information is critical for making day-to-day agricultural decisions, assisting breeding programs, and much more. To tackle this dilemma, we introduce NTrack, a novel multiple object tracking framework based on the linear relationship between the locations of neighboring tracks. NTrack computes dense optical flow and utilizes particle filtering to guide each tracker. Correspondences between detections and tracks are found through data association via direct observations and indirect cues, which are then combined to obtain an updated observation. Our modular multiple object tracking system is independent of the underlying detection method, thus allowing for the interchangeable use of any off-the-shelf object detector.

Machine learning is an effective tool for large-scale agricultural mapping, but relies on geo-referenced ground-truth data for model training and testing, which can be scarce or time-consuming to obtain. In this study, we explore the usefulness of combining a global cropland dataset and a hand-labeled dataset to train machine learning models for generating a new cropland map for Nigeria in 2020 at 10 m resolution. We provide the models with pixel-wise time series input data from remote sensing sources such as Sentinel-1 and 2, ERA5 climate data, and DEM data, in addition to binary labels indicating cropland presence. We manually labeled 1827 evenly distributed pixels across Nigeria, splitting them into 50\% training, 25\% validation, and 25\% test sets used to fit the models and test our output map. We evaluate and compare the performance of single- and multi-headed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network classifiers, a Random Forest classifier, and three existing 10 m resolution global land cover maps (Google's Dynamic World, ESRI's Land Cover, and ESA's WorldCover) on our proposed test set. Given the regional variations in cropland appearance, we additionally experimented with excluding or sub-setting the global crowd-sourced Geowiki cropland dataset, to empirically assess the trade-off between data quantity and data quality in terms of the similarity to the target data distribution of Nigeria.

Given the importance of agriculture in Tigray to livelihoods and food security, determining the impact of the war on cultivated area is critical, but quantifying this impact was difficult due to restricted movement within and into the region due to conflict-driven insecurity and blockages. Using satellite imagery and statistical area estimation techniques, we assessed changes in crop cultivation area in Tigray before and during the war. Our findings show that cultivated area was largely stable between 2020-2021 despite the widespread impacts of the war. We estimated 1,132,000 +/- 133,000 hectares of cultivation in pre-war 2020 compared to 1,217,000 +/- 132,000 hectares in mid-war 2021. Comparing changes inside and outside of a 5 km buffer around conflict events, we found a slightly higher upper confidence limit of cropland loss within the buffer (0-3%) compared to outside the buffer (0-1%). Our results support other reports that despite widespread war-related disruptions, Tigrayan farmers were largely able to sustain cultivation. Our study demonstrates the capability of remote sensing combined with machine learning and statistical techniques to provide timely, transparent area estimates for monitoring food security in regions inaccessible due to conflict.","Sun, 17 Dec 2023 21:33:07 UTC (11,785 KB)"

UASNets improve disaster management through timely surveillance and advance precision agriculture with detailed crop monitoring, thereby significantly transforming the commercial economy. UASNets revolutionize the commercial sector by offering greater efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness, highlighting their transformative impact. A fundamental aspect of these new capabilities and changes is the collection of data from rugged and remote areas. Due to their excellent mobility and maneuverability, UAVs are employed to collect data from ground sensors in harsh environments, such as natural disaster monitoring, border surveillance, and emergency response monitoring. One major challenge in these scenarios is that the movements of UAVs affect channel conditions and result in packet loss. Fast movements of UAVs lead to poor channel conditions and rapid signal degradation, resulting in packet loss. On the other hand, slow mobility of a UAV can cause buffer overflows of the ground sensors, as newly arrived data is not promptly collected by the UAV.
Our proposal to address this challenge is to minimize packet loss by jointly optimizing the velocity controls and data collection schedules of multiple UAVs.Furthermore, in UASNets, swift movements of UAVs result in poor channel conditions and fast signal attenuation, leading to an extended age of information (AoI). In contrast, slow movements of UAVs prolong flight time, thereby extending the AoI of ground this http URL address this challenge, we propose a new mean-field flight resource allocation optimization to minimize the AoI of sensory data.","Fri, 15 Dec 2023 17:04:03 UTC (16,925 KB)"

First, we observe that the ``fear of missing out'' data lead to uniform, conservative scanning policies over the whole agricultural field. Consequently, employing a non-uniform scanning approach can mitigate the expenditure of time in areas with minimal or negligible real value, while ensuring heightened precision in information-dense regions. Turning to the available informative path planning methodologies, we discern that certain methods entail intensive computational requirements, while others necessitate training on an ideal world simulator. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an active sensing coverage path planning approach, named OverFOMO, that regulates the speed of the UAV in accordance with both the relative quantity of the identified classes, i.e. crops and weeds, and the confidence level of such detections. To identify these instances, a robust Deep Learning segmentation model is deployed. The computational needs of the proposed algorithm are independent of the size of the agricultural field, rendering its applicability on modern UAVs quite straightforward. The proposed algorithm was evaluated with a simu-realistic pipeline, combining data from real UAV missions and the high-fidelity dynamics of AirSim simulator, showcasing its performance improvements over the established state of affairs for this type of missions.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in automated systems for monitoring the behavior of ruminants. Despite the developments accomplished in the last decade, there is still much to do and learn about the methods for measuring and analyzing livestock feeding behavior. Automated monitoring systems mainly use motion, acoustic, and image sensors to collect animal behavioral data. The performance evaluation of existing methods is a complex task and direct comparisons between studies are difficult. Several factors prevent a direct comparison, starting from the diversity of data and performance metrics used in the experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first tutorial-style review on the analysis of the feeding behavior of ruminants, emphasizing the relationship between sensing methodologies, signal processing and computational intelligence methods. It assesses the main sensing methodologies (i.e. based on movement, sound, images/videos and pressure) and the main techniques to measure and analyze the signals associated with feeding behavior, evaluating their use in different settings and situations.

We build on a FracTAL ResUNet trained for crop field delineation in India (median field size of 0.24 ha) and use this pre-trained model to generate pseudo labels in Mozambique (median field size of 0.06 ha). We designed multiple pseudo label selection strategies and compared the quantities, area properties, seasonal distribution, and spatial agreement of the pseudo labels against human-annotated training labels (n = 1,512). We then used the human-annotated labels and the pseudo labels for model fine-tuning and compared predictions against human field annotations (n = 2,199). Our results indicate i) a good baseline performance of the pre-trained model in both field delineation and field size estimation, and ii) the added value of regional fine-tuning with performance improvements in nearly all experiments. Moreover, we found iii) substantial performance increases when using only pseudo labels (up to 77% of the IoU increases and 68% of the RMSE decreases obtained by human labels), and iv) additional performance increases when complementing human annotations with pseudo labels.

Soil in nature is often covered by overlaying surface material, making its characterization using conventional methods challenging. In addition, the estimation of the properties of the overlaying layer is crucial for applications like wildfire assessment. This study thus proposes a Bayesian model-updating-based approach for ground penetrating radar (GPR) waveform inversion to predict sub-surface properties like the moisture contents and depths of the soil layer and overlaying material accumulated above the soil. The dielectric permittivity of material layers were predicted with the proposed method, along with other parameters, including depth and electrical conductivity of layers. The proposed Bayesian model updating approach yields probabilistic estimates of these parameters that can provide information about the confidence and uncertainty related to the estimates. The methodology was evaluated for a diverse range of experimental data collected through laboratory and field investigations. Laboratory investigations included variations in soil moisture values and depth of the top layer (or overlaying material), and the field investigation included measurement of field soil moisture for sixteen days. The results demonstrated predictions consistent with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements and conventional gravimetric tests. The top layer depth could also be predicted with reasonable accuracy. The proposed method provides a promising approach for uncertainty-aware sub-surface parameter estimation that can enable decision-making for risk assessment across a wide range of applications.","Wed, 13 Dec 2023 06:54:30 UTC (2,366 KB)"
"137","Spatial Knowledge-Infused Hierarchical Learning: An Application in Flood Mapping on Earth Imagery","Zelin Xu, Tingsong Xiao, Wenchong He, Yu Wang, Zhe Jiang","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Deep learning for Earth imagery plays an increasingly important role in geoscience applications such as agriculture, ecology, and natural disaster management. Still, progress is often hindered by the limited training labels. Given Earth imagery with limited training labels, a base deep neural network model, and a spatial knowledge base with label constraints, our problem is to infer the full labels while training the neural network. The problem is challenging due to the sparse and noisy input labels, spatial uncertainty within the label inference process, and high computational costs associated with a large number of sample locations. Existing works on neuro-symbolic models focus on integrating symbolic logic into neural networks (e.g., loss function, model architecture, and training label augmentation), but these methods do not fully address the challenges of spatial data (e.g., spatial uncertainty, the trade-off between spatial granularity and computational costs). To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Spatial Knowledge-Infused Hierarchical Learning (SKI-HL) framework that iteratively infers sample labels within a multi-resolution hierarchy. Our framework consists of a module to selectively infer labels in different resolutions based on spatial uncertainty and a module to train neural network parameters with uncertainty-aware multi-instance learning. Extensive experiments on real-world flood mapping datasets show that the proposed model outperforms several baseline methods.

Pinheiro, Dominik Hartmann","General Economics (econ.GN)","Research on productive structures has shown that economic complexity conditions economic growth. However, little is known about which type of complexity, e.g., export or industrial complexity, matters more for regional economic growth in a large emerging country like Brazil. Brazil exports natural resources and agricultural goods, but a large share of the employment derives from services, non-tradables, and within-country manufacturing trade. Here, we use a large dataset on Brazil's formal labor market, including approximately 100 million workers and 581 industries, to reveal the patterns of export complexity, industrial complexity, and economic growth of 558 micro-regions between 2003 and 2019. Our results show that export complexity is more evenly spread than industrial complexity. Only a few -- mainly developed urban places -- have comparative advantages in sophisticated services. Regressions show that a region's industrial complexity is a significant predictor for 3-year growth prospects, but export complexity is not. Moreover, economic complexity in neighboring regions is significantly associated with economic growth. The results show export complexity does not appropriately depict Brazil's knowledge base and growth opportunities. Instead, promoting the sophistication of the heterogeneous regional industrial structures and development spillovers is a key to growth.","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 17:50:28 UTC (7,569 KB)"

To address this issue, we stabilize the soil using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). PVA strongly adheres to the soil after mixing and annealing, enhancing the cohesive strength of the soil. The PVA-soil withstands the impact of water at 7 m/s, protecting it from rainfall-induced erosion. Furthermore, the water-retaining capability and drainage of PVA-soil can be adjusted based on its sizes. This customized PVA-soil provides optimal growing conditions for various plants in different climates. Our method contributes to improved soil management and conversion.","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 07:32:20 UTC (494 KB)[v2] Fri, 15 Dec 2023 10:55:38 UTC (4,140 KB)[v3] Thu, 28 Dec 2023 10:33:59 UTC (8,701 KB)"

A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach is used to make the shape of a deformable object reach a set of desired points by controlling a robotic arm which manipulates it. Our framework is more easily generalizable than existing ones: it can work directly with different initial and desired final shapes without need for relearning. We achieve this by using learning parallelization, i.e., executing multiple agents in parallel on various environment instances. We focus our study on deformable linear objects. These objects are interesting in industrial and agricultural domains, yet their manipulation with robots, especially in 3D workspaces, remains challenging. We simulate the entire environment, i.e., the soft object and the robot, for the training and the testing using PyBullet and OpenAI Gym. We use a combination of state-of-the-art DRL techniques, the main ingredient being a training approach for the learning agent (i.e., the robot) based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our simulation results support the usefulness and enhanced generality of the proposed approach.","Fri, 8 Dec 2023 14:25:13 UTC (2,620 KB)"

Our framework provides i) robust pest population predictions across diverse environments with invariant and causal learning, ii) interpretable pest presence predictions using transparent models, iii) actionable advice through counterfactual explanations for in-season IPM interventions, iv) field-specific treatment effect estimations, and v) assessments of the effectiveness of our advice using causal inference.

However, a major challenge lies in acquiring accurate deformation models that describe the relationship between robot motion and DLO deformations. Such models are difficult to calculate analytically and vary among DLOs. Consequently, manipulating DLOs poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving large deformations that require highly accurate global models. To address these challenges, this paper presents MultiAC6: a new multi Actor-Critic framework for robot action space decomposition to control large 3D deformations of DLOs. In our approach, two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents orient and position a robot gripper to deform a DLO into the desired shape. Unlike previous DRL-based studies, MultiAC6 is able to solve the sim-to-real gap, achieving large 3D deformations up to 40 cm in real-world settings. Experimental results also show that MultiAC6 has a 66\% higher success rate than a single-agent approach. Further experimental studies demonstrate that MultiAC6 generalizes well, without retraining, to DLOs with different lengths or materials.","Thu, 7 Dec 2023 14:07:17 UTC (5,284 KB)[v2] Fri, 8 Dec 2023 12:46:04 UTC (5,284 KB)"
"145","Multi-agricultural Machinery Collaborative Task Assignment Based on Improved Genetic Hybrid Optimization Algorithm","Haohao Du","Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)","To address the challenges of delayed scheduling information, heavy reliance on manual labour, and low operational efficiency in traditional large-scale agricultural machinery operations, this study proposes a method for multi-agricultural machinery collaborative task assignment based on an improved genetic hybrid optimisation algorithm. The proposed method establishes a multi-agricultural machinery task allocation model by combining the path pre-planning of a simulated annealing algorithm and the static task allocation of a genetic algorithm. By sequentially fusing these two algorithms, their respective shortcomings can be overcome, and their advantages in global and local search can be utilised. Consequently, the search capability of the population is enhanced, leading to the discovery of more optimal solutions. Then, an adaptive crossover operator is constructed according to the task assignment model, considering the capacity, path cost, and time of agricultural machinery; two-segment coding and multi-population adaptive mutation are used to assign tasks to improve the diversity of the population and enhance the exploration ability of the population; and to improve the global optimisation ability of the hybrid algorithm, a 2-Opt local optimisation operator and an Circle modification algorithm are introduced. Finally, simulation experiments were conducted in MATLAB to evaluate the performance of the multi-agricultural machinery collaborative task assignment based on the improved genetic hybrid algorithm. The algorithm's capabilities were assessed through comparative analysis in the simulation trials. The results demonstrate that the developed hybrid algorithm can effectively reduce path costs, and the efficiency of the assignment outcomes surpasses that of the classical genetic algorithm. This approach proves particularly suitable for addressing large-scale task allocation problems.","Thu, 7 Dec 2023 12:42:40 UTC (2,724 KB)"

Paul, Johannes Leonhardt, Sabine J. Seidel, Thomas F. Döring, Ribana Roscher","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Image-based crop growth modeling can substantially contribute to precision agriculture by revealing spatial crop development over time, which allows an early and location-specific estimation of relevant future plant traits, such as leaf area or biomass. A prerequisite for realistic and sharp crop image generation is the integration of multiple growth-influencing conditions in a model, such as an image of an initial growth stage, the associated growth time, and further information about the field treatment. We present a two-stage framework consisting first of an image prediction model and second of a growth estimation model, which both are independently trained. The image prediction model is a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (CWGAN). In the generator of this model, conditional batch normalization (CBN) is used to integrate different conditions along with the input image. This allows the model to generate time-varying artificial images dependent on multiple influencing factors of different kinds. These images are used by the second part of the framework for plant phenotyping by deriving plant-specific traits and comparing them with those of non-artificial (real) reference images. For various crop datasets, the framework allows realistic, sharp image predictions with a slight loss of quality from short-term to long-term predictions. Simulations of varying growth-influencing conditions performed with the trained framework provide valuable insights into how such factors relate to crop appearances, which is particularly useful in complex, less explored crop mixture systems. Further results show that adding process-based simulated biomass as a condition increases the accuracy of the derived phenotypic traits from the predicted images. This demonstrates the potential of our framework to serve as an interface between an image- and process-based crop growth model.","Wed, 6 Dec 2023 11:54:50 UTC (36,512 KB)"

This evolution involves incorporating data science, machine learning, sensor technologies, robotics, and new management strategies to establish a more sustainable agricultural framework. So far, machine learning research in digital agriculture has predominantly focused on model-centric approaches, focusing on model design and evaluation. These efforts aim to optimize model accuracy and efficiency, often treating data as a static benchmark. Despite the availability of agricultural data and methodological advancements, a saturation point has been reached, with many established machine learning methods achieving comparable levels of accuracy and facing similar limitations. To fully realize the potential of digital agriculture, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the role of data in the field and to adopt data-centric machine learning.

Reddy, Wenguang Sun, Chittaranjan Ray, Dennis Timlin, Arindam Malakar","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","The cotton industry in the United States is committed to sustainable production practices that minimize water, land, and energy use while improving soil health and cotton output. Climate-smart agricultural technologies are being developed to boost yields while decreasing operating expenses. Crop yield prediction, on the other hand, is difficult because of the complex and nonlinear impacts of cultivar, soil type, management, pest and disease, climate, and weather patterns on crops. To solve this issue, we employ machine learning (ML) to forecast production while considering climate change, soil diversity, cultivar, and inorganic nitrogen levels. From the 1980s to the 1990s, field data were gathered across the southern cotton belt of the United States. To capture the most current effects of climate change over the previous six years, a second data source was produced using the process-based crop model, GOSSYM. We concentrated our efforts on three distinct areas inside each of the three southern states: Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia. To simplify the amount of computations, accumulated heat units (AHU) for each set of experimental data were employed as an analogy to use time-series weather data. The Random Forest Regressor yielded a 97.75% accuracy rate, with a root mean square error of 55.05 kg/ha and an R2 of around 0.98. These findings demonstrate how an ML technique may be developed and applied as a reliable and easy-to-use model to support the cotton climate-smart initiative.","Mon, 4 Dec 2023 19:33:29 UTC (498 KB)"
